Use this guide as a reference on how <B>Saskatchewan Interactive</B> is "put together" and the best ways to use the information contained within. At any time while reading through the following material, the user may exit to the main Saskatchewan Interactive menu by clicking on the Saskatchewan Interactive Main Menu icon located at the top left of the screen.   <P><B>Setup</B><P>This CD-ROM is produced using the <B>ISO 9660 </B>format. This format allows the same CD to be used on different typesof computers i.e. PC compatible and Macintosh. If you are having trouble seeing the CD on your desktop or under My Computer (Win 95), then you are probably missing the ISO 9660 drivers. Early editions of Windows and Mac System 7 do not install these drivers as part of the normal operating system installation. You can easily obtain the correct drivers (from the Internet) or by installing the software from a later edition of Windows 95 (OSR2 or later) or Mac operating systems (System 7.5 or later).<p><B>Browser Setup</B><p> This project is designed for viewing using a <I>version 4 browser</I>  e.g Microsoft Explorer 4.x. or  Netscape 4.x . The CD-ROM contains the installer for Microsoft Explorer 4.01 for both Mac and PC. Version 3.x browsers could give javascript error messages when accessing some pages. DO NOT USE Explorer 3.0x.  Both browsers use plugins to view web page content.   Saskatchewan Interactive requires that you have the Quicktime 3.x plugin installed to enable you to view the images correctly.(The Quicktime installer is also included on the CD-Rom)<p>Since the individual's browser (e.g. Netscape 4.x) sets the font size, the user should set the font size under the Browser preferences. If the size is wrong, the centre line on the double column pages will appear to be too short or too long. Generally, Window's users should set the font to <I>Times Roman 10 point</I>; Mac Users to <I>Times Roman 14 point</I>.<p><B>PC users</B> can set up Microsoft Explorer 4.x by selecting the default font size under the <B>View menu</B> - Internet Options. Press the font button and choose <B>Times New Roman</B> from the <B>Proportional Font</B> drop down menu. Choose <B>small</B> under the <B>Fontsize</B> drop down menu. In Netscape 4.x select Edit Menu/Preferences. Click on Appearance/fonts in the left side window. Set the variable width font to size 10 point.<br><p><B>Mac users</B> can set up the default font size under Menu <B>Edit</B> - Preferences of Explorer 4.01. Select language fonts from the left window.Set <B>Proportional font</B> to <B>Times new Roman</B>. Under the <B>View</B> menu select textsize <B>large</B>.<p><B>Display</B>.<p> Displays should be set to millions of colours (24 bit). Win 95 users set from Startup menu/control panels/display/settings. Mac users access <I>Control Panel</I> under <I>Apple Menu</I> - select <I>Monitors and Sound</I> <p><p><B> CPU Speed</B><p> This project uses the latest technology and requires a fast cpu to view properly.  We recommend at least a Pentium 100 mHz or PowerMac 100 mHz with a 4X CD-ROM drive.<p><B>Overview of Saskatchewan Interactive</B><P> Saskatchewan Interactive is an information package which contains resource material  about the major natural resources of Saskatchewan.  The main content is geared toward a Grade Nine/Ten reading level.  This is not to say that the content is targeted for Grade Nine students,  but it is intended that the information would be useful to many grade levels and  subject areas as well as a general interest resource on Saskatchewan. By making the content interactive through the use of activities, questions, quizzes,  various media (including Virtual Field Trips), interactive tables, pages and active links,  the reader will enjoy a closer look at our province and the resources contained therein. <P>Saskatchewan Interactive contains several thousand files, and covers a variety  of topics yet there is still much more information that cannot possibly be included. Throughout the modules, several  resources are listed to help the reader locate additional information. and in some cases actually see parts of the province that would otherwise never be visited by the user.  The <B>Virtual Field Trips</B> utilize virtual reality technology (Quicktime VR). VR allows the user to view,  panoramically, a northern lake, the inside of a mine or the road travelled  by forestry service vehicles. <P><B>Overview of Modules</B><P>Saskatchewan Interactive consists of six main modules (each divided into subtopics which are then subdivided further). These main modules are:<OL><LI>Agriculture<LI>Environment<LI>Fisheries<LI>Forestry<LI>Mining<LI>Tourism</OL><P>Each module contains a main index of information, which includes a description of each area that is discussed, as well as a glossary and activities section. As you move through each module, the main topic areas are further subdivided; much like chapters and sections in a textbook. At any time, you may access any of the modules by clicking the Saskatchewan Interactive icon located in the top left-hand corner of your screen. This will take you to the main page of Saskatchewan Interactive that contains the main menu of modules.<P>Each module contains information on that particular Saskatchewan resource. For example, if you would like to know about the types of mining that occur in our province, you would access the <B>Mining Module</B>, then the <B>Search, Exploration and Development</B> section, and choose the <B>Types of Mining</B> section. <P>As mentioned, each section contains activities that are geared to students in the upper grade levels. Many of these activities can be modified for the lower grades, and for learners of varying ages. Each activity specifies its relation to the Saskatchewan Evergreen Curriculum. See the activities for more information.<P>Each main module contains a series of quizzes that you may use to test your knowledge of the subject at hand. These may be accessed from the module's main index page. More on this may be found below.<P>Contained within each module is a glossary. Accessing the glossary of a module is simple; from the main menu of the module, click glossary and then choose the letter of the term you are trying to locate.<P>    The quick links icon will take you to a page listing all the index pages. It's a quick way to navigate to a new area of Saskatchewan Interactive at anytime. These may be found on each index page.<P><B>Accessing Main Module Sub-content</B><P>In order to access the content of a module, its main page must be loaded (or gain access using the quick links button). You may then choose any of the subtopics in the same manner as you used to access the module itself; click the topic by choosing the side bar quick links or choose the title from the index page displayed. It is possible to access subtopics by choosing the page next button. This allows you to move through each topic area of a module sequentially, as you would move through a textbook, page by page. The end of each section will return you to either the main index page of that module or the Saskatchewan Interactive index page. <P><B>Accessing Main Module Activities</B><P>The activities that are part of the Saskatchewan Interactive site are designed to appeal to a variety of learners. There are group activities, individual activities, field trips, projects, presentations and so on. You can choose to do none, some or all of the activities with your students. In each activity, there is a background information page to explain how the activities are set up and to be used. The activities can be accessed by going to the main index page for the module of your choice and then choosing the activates section (side bar as a quick link or text section on page). The activities main menu for that module willappear with choices - choose the activity of your choice or go to the information page. Remember that you may access each activity sequentially by choosing page next from the bottom of your screen.<P> <B>Accessing and Using Module Quizzes</B><P>By entering the main index page of each module, you will be able to access the quizzes that have been written for each section within that module. The quizzes are designed for ease of the user...as multiple choice test items. At anytime while trying the quiz, you may access a "hint" page where the answer may be located. By closing the hint window, you will be taken back to the quiz. you will know if you have chosen a correct response (or not!).<P><B>Where am I in the Saskatchewan Interactive Site?</B><P>The Saskatchewan Interactive site consists of six main modules and subtopics within each. Some subtopics may be divided even further. Each document is identified a the top of the page and at the side bar. <P>The quickest way to find out where you are in the entire Saskatchewan Interactive site, is to look at the side bar menu. The top left hand corner always has the home page icon. Below this will appear the icon title of the module that you currently in , as well as the subtopic title icon (if you have accessed a subtopic). <P>You may find that when you access a topic from an index, another index menu pops up. By looking at the side bar, you will find that you are indeed in the area that you chose, and that this is now an index of that topic. The index pages are arranged so that you may choose any of the topics, in random order, by clicking the titles on the index page. Quick links work in the same manner, but are arranged sequentially. The page next button, if used from an index page, will take you through the information sequentially (as in a textbook). Any areas you have visited within the Saskatchewan Interactive site will be indicated by the link color. Generally, links that have not been accessed remain blue in color.<P>  <B>Using page next/previous page</B>(using browser - back/forward buttons)<P>Three buttons are located at the bottom of each page of the Saskatchewan Interactive site. These are the page top, page previous and page next buttons. In order to jump to the top of the screen, choose the page top button. You may also move back and forth in the document by using the scroll bar and scroll arrows. <P>The page previous button is used like the page back button on your browser. By clicking the page previous button, you will go back one page in sequence within the Saskatchewan Interactive site. Using this button will not give you access to the Internet directly if you are online for this resource.<P>If you would like to move forward in the Saskatchewan Interactive site, sequentially one page, then choose the page next button. All documents in the Saskatchewan Interactive site have been placed in a certain sequence. By choosing the page next button at the beginning of each main module, and then on each subsequent page, you will access each page within that document in the order they were placed. Choosing the next page button will not give the user access to the Internet.<P>  <B>Using index pages to move through module</B><P>You may proceed through the Saskatchewan Interactive site in various ways. One way is to choose a topic from any one of the index pages. These pages contain three or more main headings and a brief description of each topic within that index page. Each heading is linked to the corresponding section. Once a link is established, the link color will change from blue to another, depending on your browser and monitor. As well, you may use the Quick LInks located on the side bar. These are located on each index page and when activated, will take you to that topic area specified.<P><B>Using Quicklinks</B> <P>Quicklinks are listed  on the side bar to the left of the text on your screen and are present on each main index page. These links outline the main topics for each section and are listed in sequence. Using the Quick Links will take you directly to that topic, in the same manner that choosing the topic heading from the index page will accomplish.<P><B>Accessing all information in each module</B><P>There are several thousand documents in the Saskatchewan Interactive site. The best method to access each and every page is to begin at the Home page and choose one of the main modules, then move through that module using the page next button. To access all modules, return to the home page once you have completed one module and choose another module.  Remember that at any time you may jump to a different module by clicking the home page icon and then choosing a new module. You may also use the search mode to find information appropriate to your area of study.<P><B>Accessing information from within module</B><P> (tables, quizzes etc interactive material within each module)<P>Saskatchewan Interactive is filled with sections that require participation from the learner. For example, in the Fisheries module, in the Habitat section, the user must access additional information regarding fish spinal diseases by clicking in the table provided in the column "more information". Other sections require the user to answer questions before proceeding to the next section and still other sections may be accessed after the user has read through information that will help them to reach conclusions about that information. In each case, the user has other options that will provide the information (like choosing the page next function).<P><B>Media</B><P>Throughout Saskatchewan Interactive are photos, images, diagrams, movie clips, sound files and virtual field trips. These enhance the material and hopefully "take" the user closer to the actual subject. <UL><LI>Viewing video (with button commands/ as is)<P>Many movie clips become active in the Saskatchewan Interactive site once the page has completely downloaded from the source. These clips do not require the user to do any more than to sit and enjoy the "movie". Other clips must be "played" in the same manner one would play a video. Click the play button once the document has completely downloaded from the source. You may stop, pause or reverse the clip by using the buttons provided on screen. Volume adjustment is user based on the equipment being used.<P><LI>Listening to audio<P>Several audio clips are present in the site. To hear the clip, simply click the play button once the document has completely downloaded from the source. You may stop, pause and rewind the clip by choosing the appropriate buttons on screen.<P> <LI>Viewing Images<P>The majority of images in the Saskatchewan Interactive site may be viewed full screen by clicking the Hi-res image button located beside the thumbnail image. To return to the page you were on, simply click the close box on the image window. <P><LI>Why do images (and other media) not appear on the screen?<P>If you do not see images on your screen or do not have the QuickTime VR's, be sure to check out the system requirements for this site. Access the home page (click the home page button located in the top left hand side of the screen) and click the requirements section. If you do not have the required components, links have been made to the necessary component sites on the Internet.<P><LI>Quick Time&#153;VR's<P>Each main index page and a few section pages contain a Quick Time&#153; VR (a virtual field trip!) By moving the mouse over the picture, you will observe a type of panoramic view of the image. You may zoom in by holding the shift (IBM) or alt (Mac) key; or zoom out by holding the control (IBM and Mac) key.<P><LI>Viewing Animations<P>Saskatchewan Interactive contains animations (check out the Forestry Module, Living Tree section) which, once loaded, provide the viewer with a unique way to see the subject. These animation are active until the user moves on to a new page.<P> </UL></td></tr></table><P></FONT></H2></TD></TR></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 	ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')" 	ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF = "../index.html" 	ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')" 	ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "../misc/credits.html" 	ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')" 	ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
