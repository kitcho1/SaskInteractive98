These trees by number and distributionor by average dbh, basal area, or volume are such that at rotationage they will produce a timber stand that occupies the potentiallyproductive ground. They will provide a merchantable timber yieldaccording to the potential of the land. The stocking, number oftrees, and distribution required to achieve this will be determinedfrom regional or local yield tables or by some other appropriatemethod.<LI><B>nonstocked</B>: Productive forest land that lacks treescompletely or that is so deficient in trees, either young or old,that at the end of one rotation, the residual stand of merchantabletree species, if any, will be insufficient to allow utilizationin an economic operation.<LI><B>normally stocked</B>: Productive forest land covered withtrees of merchantable species of any age. These trees, by numberand distribution, or by average dbh, basal area, or volume, aresuch that at rotation age they will produce a timber stand ofthe maximum merchantable timber yield. This yield must satisfythe site potential of the land as reported by the best availableregional or local yield tables. For stands of less than rotationage, a range of stocking classes both above and below normal maybe predicted to approach and produce a normal stocking at rotationage and may, therefore, be included. This is because greater orlesser mortality rates will occur in over- or understocked standsas compared with those in a normal stand.<LI><B>NSR</B> (not sufficiently or not satisfactorily restockedor regenerated): Inadequate stocking. Productive forest land thathas been denuded and has failed partially or completely to regeneratenaturally or to be artificially regenerated. The regenerationmust contain a minimum number of well-established, healthy treesthat are free-to-grow and sufficient to produce a merchantabletimber stand at rotation age. In a number of provinces, forestlands that have been recently harvested and that are not yet classifiedas satisfactorily stocked are classified as NSR. This classificationdoes not necessarily imply that re-treatment is required to correcta failure to regenerate.<LI><B>overstocked</B>: Productive forest land stocked with moretrees of merchantable species than normal or full stocking wouldrequire. Growth is in some respect retarded and the full numberof trees will not reach merchantable size by rotation age accordingto the regional or local yield or stock tables for the particularsite and species.<LI><B>partially stocked</B>: Productive forest land stocked withtrees of merchantable species insufficient to utilise the completepotential of the land for growth such that they will not occupythe whole site by rotation age without additional stocking. Explicitdefinition in stems per hectare, crown closure, relative basalarea, etc. is locally or regionally defined and is site-specific.<LI><B>satisfactorily stocked</B>: Productive forest land thathas been regenerated naturally or artificially to at least a minimumnumber of well-established, healthy trees of merchantable speciesthat are free-to-grow and sufficient to produce a merchantabletimber stand at rotation age.</dl><p></UL><DL><B>Stool</B></B>	<DD><B>1</B>.
