Buta tree is more than the sum of these parts - it is a living, functioningorganism. Trees, in fact, are among the most widespread, the largest,the longest living, and the most successful of all living thingson the planet. This lesson examines how a tree is designed andthe functions played by each of its different parts. It exploreshow they all work together to keep the tree alive and growing.<P>A key to understanding tree design is the fact that the bulk ofa mature tree is made up of <B>dead tissue</B>, whose sole functionfor the tree is to provide protection and structural support.Only about one per cent of a tree&Igrave;s volume consists ofliving cells that need constant maintenance. Nourishment for thesecells comes from both ends of the tree - from sugars manufacturedin the leaves at the top and from water and minerals drawn upby the roots at the bottom.<P>The roots of a tree have several functions. <UL><LI>They anchor the tree in the soil; </UL><P><UL><LI>they absorb and conduct water and mineral salts;</UL> <UL><LI>and, in some species, the roots may sprout to produce newseedlings. </UL><P>Water and dissolved minerals enter the tree from the soil throughfine root hairs, which are only 0.01mm in diameter and live forjust a few days. Most of the root is inactive, but growing tissueat the root tips produces new root hairs that push the roots deeperinto the soil.<P>The water and minerals absorbed by the roots pass up the trunkto the branches and leaves. Water is conducted through the treein tissue composed of <B>xylem cells</B> . In deciduous trees,the elongated xylem cells join end to end to form long, open,microscopic pipes called <B>vessels</B>. A single vessel may beseveral metres long. In coniferous species, water conduction iscarried out by needle shaped cells called <B>tracheids</B>, whichare 3 to 5 mm long and about 0.03 mm wide. Tracheids have smallopenings or<B> pits</B> at their ends. These openings overlapwith those of other tracheids, forming open gateways for waterto pass through from one cell to another. The special design ofthese water conducting cells allows them to carry water to a considerableheight against the force of gravity, to supply the needs of thetissues at the top of the tree.<P>The exact process by which water is taken up by plants againstthe force of gravity is not fully known. The most commonly acceptedtheory to explain this process is the <B>cohesion-pull theory</B>,which involves principles of osmosis, molecular cohesion, capillaryaction, and transpiration. Essentially, water is drawn up thelong, fine cells by capillary action, a term describing the tendencyof water to move in fine spaces because of the molecular attractionbetween the water molecules and the vessel walls. (Capillary actionis also responsible for the movement of water up through soil.)In the leaves, water is expelled to the atmosphere by evaporationin the process of transpiration. This loss of water creates anosmotic pressure, exerting a pull through the water-conductingtissues that, together with capillary action, allows the plantto raise water up 100m or more to the top of the highest trees.This is well above the limit of tom, the maximum height to whichwater can be raised against the force of gravity by human-madesuction pumps.<P>Water has two main functions in the tree. <UL><LI>The pressure of the columns of water moving through the planthelps to give the tissues strength and rigidity. You can see thisclearly in smaller plants that do not have any woody tissue forsupport. They depend on their water columns to keep their tissuesfirm and upright; in hot, dry weather, such plants droop and bendover because they are unable to keep enough water moving throughtheir stems. Water must be constantly drawn up by the roots toreplace the water lost through transpiration. A large leafy treemay draw up and transpire as much as 900L of water every day -enough to fill a bathtub four times. <LI>Water is required in the process of photosynthesis, in whichsugars are manufactured in the leaves from water and carbon dioxideusing the energy of the sun. The sugars provide energy for activeand growing cells. Sugars are transported from the leaves to therest of the tree through phloem cells located in the inner bark.</UL><P><B><A NAME="resources">Resources</A></B><P><P>1.
