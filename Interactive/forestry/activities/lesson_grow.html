In the spring, before buds have flushed, collect twigs as partof a field trip activity. Cuttings can be kept frozen in plasticbags until needed, then slowly thawed. Stress that permissionshould be asked before cutting twigs from trees or shrubs on privateor public property. Cut twigs with a sharp knife blade or snippingshears. Remove twigs that won't noticeably affect the generalappearance of the tree, and don't take all the twigs from thesame spot or side.<p>2.

In the competitiveworld of the forest, the vast majority of seeds do not in factever produce mature trees. Only a few that land on suitable ground,get enough exposure to sunlight and water, and are not eaten ordamaged by animals and diseases eventually grow up to become adulttrees in the forest.<BR><P>Look at the trees on your local streets and in parks. Every treehas a different size and shape, depending on the rate and patternin which new cells are added to it each year. You can think oftree growth in two ways. First, the trunks grow outwards and upwardsfrom their tips, carrying their leaves towards the sun. This growthproduces extra height and spread. Second, the trunk and branchesgrow thicker and sturdier, allowing them to support the addedweight of the larger branches.<P>Despite their variations in appearance, all trees have essentiallythe same basic structure. They have a central column - the trunk- supporting a framework of branches. The branches in turn bearan outside covering layer of leaves. Anchoring the tree in theground is a network of roots, which spreads and grows thickerin proportion to the growth of the tree above the ground. In amature tree, most of the cells of the trunk, roots, and branchesare dead or inactive. All growth of new tissue takes place atonly a few points on the tree, by the division of specializedcells. These actively growing areas are located at the tips ofbranches and roots and in a thin layer just inside the bark.<BR><P>If you look at a branch on a deciduous tree during the winterwhen the leaves are gone, you can see <B>terminal buds </B>atthe very ends of the twigs. These are the points from which thenext spring's growth will take place. Twigs also have side or<B>lateral buds, </B>from which side branches develop. Buds areformed in the summer and fall and remain dormant over winter.Dormancy is broken when suitable growing conditions return, usuallyin the spring.<BR><P>If you look further back along a twig, you will come to a ringof thickened bark. This scar tissue marks the place where theterminal bud grew the previous year and is called the <B>terminalbud scar. </B>The distance between the scar and the new terminalbud is therefore the amount of growth that took place in one year.Knowing this, you can find the age of several branches of differentsizes on your tree.<BR><P>As the main trunk of the tree grows taller, it also grows thicker.Its structure can be thought of as an extremely elongated coneshape, with the base of the trunk, being the oldest part, slightlythicker than the rest of the trunk. You can visualize this growthpattern by inverting and stacking a number of paper cups on oneanother. Each cup column represents a year's growth. The narrowbottom of each cup (pointing upwards in the column) representsthe terminal bud. Each year's growth fits tightly around the previousyear's and increases the height of the tree. While the growthin height comes from the terminal buds, the growth in girth comesfrom a thin layer of cells called the <B>cambium, </B>found betweenthe inner bark and the wood of the trunk and branches. In thepaper cup model, the cambium is represented by the outside surfaceof the cups.<BR><P>The growth rate and the ultimate height and shape of a tree aregoverned partly by the growing conditions of its environment,but also by its genes. In optimal conditions of sunlight and moisture,different species reach different maximum heights. The tallestspecies of trees are the coastal redwoods, which grow on the westcoast of California and Oregon and reach heights up to 112 m.A tree can continue to grow for as long as it lives, so its ultimateheight depends on its growth rate and its longevity. Height canhowever be adversely affected by environmental factors such aslong periods of cold summers and insect attacks.<BR><P>The shape of a tree depends on many factors, such as the amountof space it has to grow in, the amount of sunshine and moistureit receives, the relative growth rate of its terminal and lateralbranches, and any damage it receives from such factors as lightning,fires, prevailing winds, snow, animals, and disease. The partof the tree above the trunk, called the <B>crown, </B>is builtup bit by bit and year by year in order to maximize the leaves'exposure to the sun's energy. The direction of growth of the branchesis towards the light. Trees that can reach above their neighboursget the most sunshine and are said to have <B>dominant crowns.</B>Those that are shaded by other trees may be slower growingand are called <B>suppressed trees. </B>In some species, suchas poplar, continued shading over several years will eventuallylead to their death. Other species, however, called <B>shade tolerant,</B>can survive long periods in low levels of light. Species suchas white spruce establish themselves under a canopy and eventuallybecome dominant as pioneer species die off.<BR><P>While a great height and large crown give a tree more exposureto sunlight, they make the branches more vulnerable to damagefrom severe winds or heavy snow. To balance the spread of itsbranches, a tree tends to grow deeper roots to anchor it firmlyagainst toppling by storms. Jack pines have large deep tap rootswhich enable them to root themselves well in shallow sandy soilsand access water. Spruce trees have a shallow root network whichleaves the trees susceptible to wind blow when the tree is exposed.Such exposure may come from removal of adjacent trees during loggingoperations or when a road is being built or, naturally when afire leaves a strip of trees along a lake as it goes through anarea.<BR><P>In general, the crowns of trees growing in Saskatchewan take ontwo basic forms: <B>conical and round. </B>In conical forms -such as the familiar spruce tree - the terminal bud grows muchfaster than the lateral branches. The resulting conical form helpsthe tree shed snow and ice, and its compact shape resists windpressure. For this reason, the conical form is most common intrees growing farther north. In the milder climatic areas associatedwith mixed wood forest and southern parkland, the predominantform is that of the spreading, more rounded crown, typical ofaspens and elms.<BR><P>Besides its branches, roots, and leaves, a mature tree grows oneother important structure -- the flower (or cone, in the caseof evergreens). These are the reproductive structures from whichthe seeds are produced. Fast-growing species may mature and produceseeds after as little as five to 10 years' growth, while otherspecies take 30 to 40 years to mature. A certain size is neededbefore flowering takes place, and suppressed trees may not flowereven at an age of 50 to 100 years or more. With the growth offlowers, fruit, and seeds, the life cycle of the tree comes fullcircle. The seeds are dispersed by wind, water, or animals, andthe few that find a suitable spot will germinate and begin theirjourneys of growth toward the sun.<BR><P><B><A NAME="notes">Notes</A>:</B><P>1. The purpose of the Activity # 1 is to observe and measure twiggrowth and to observe the effects of a sucrose solution on thebuds. The experiment demonstrates not only how new growth occursfrom buds, but also the phenomenon of dormancy. This is a springactivity, as twigs require a cold period before dormancy can bebroken.<BR><P>2. Activity #2 and the two graphing exercises for Activity #3are intended to help students appreciate some of the factors thataffect the growth of trees.<P><B><A NAME="resources">Resources:</A></B><P>l. <I>How a Tree Grows</I>, a poster available from the SaskatchewanForestry Association.<p><b><A NAME="links">Related Internet Links:</A></b><p><ul><li>Saskatchewan Education <a href="http://www.sasked.gov.sk.ca/docs/midlsci/gr9uamsc.html" target="bigwindow">Evergreen Curriculum</a><p><li><A HREF="http://www.canadian-forests.com/index.html" target="bigwindow">Canadian Forests</A></ul><p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./lesson_biosphere.html">		<A HREF="./lesson_biosphere.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./lesson_grow_1.html">		<A HREF="./lesson_grow_1.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
