Silviculturalpractices in Canada have developed in response to local or regionalneeds and as a result, are constantly changing and evolving. <BR><P><B><A NAME="historical">Historical Development</A></B><UL><LI>From 1910 to 1950, Canadian silviculture was primarily concernedwith planting trees on prairie farms and abandoned farmland ineastern Canada. Unassisted natural regeneration was relied onin the logging of public forests. <p><LI>During the 1950-1970 period, much effort was put into waysto assist the natural regeneration process by cut modification,scarification, and preparation of ecologically based natural regenerationprescriptions. Some planting and tree-improvement programs werestarted in this period. <p><LI>Between 1970 and 1980 emphasis was placed on quality plantingand dealing with unsatisfactorily restocked (NSR) lands, includingexpanded use of herbicides.<p><LI>The period 1980-1990 saw further expansion of planting programsto cover over 25% of the approximately 900 000 ha of annual cutover.</UL><P>Initially, most silvicultural programs were implemented by governmentagencies. During the 1980s, the silvicultural contracting industryexpanded rapidly as government programs were privatized. Increasingemphasis<I> </I>was placed on customizing and designing silviculturaland forest management programs to forest age-class structuresto ensure continuity of wood flows. By 1990, most surplus allowablecut in the provinces had been taken up by new industrial expansion.Although most logging operations are still cutting, and will continueto cut old-growth virgin timber, the end of this supply is nowapproaching. <BR><P>The emphasis of silvicultural practices has shifted from almosttotal concern over successful regeneration to a more balancedand designed program of regeneration and stand-tending actions,based on pre-harvest silvicultural prescriptions. This shift inemphasis has focused attention to pre-commercial thinning, pruning,tree improvement, commercial thinning, and fertilizing to producequality stands in the time frame imposed by declining old-growthreserves.<P>As public concern about the appearance and environmental effectsof clearcutting (the dominant harvesting practice) mount, increasinglyattempts are made in silvicultural prescriptions to use appropriatealternative harvesting systems that meet multiple land-use constraintsimposed by public demands, the concerns of wildlife, recreation,and watershed managers, and the mandatory requirement for successfulregeneration.<BR><P><B><A NAME="practices">Basic Silvicultural Practices</A><BR></B><P>Basic silvicultural practices are regarded as the minimal performanceneeded on public lands to ensure that the new crop of trees willbe as good as or exceed the productivity of the original stand.Provincial forest service policies seek to assign to each Canadiangeneration a limited equity in forest resource property and topass it undamaged from generation to generation. Basic silviculturalpractices are seen to satisfy this ethical responsibility.<BR><P><B><A NAME="eco">Ecological Classification</A><BR></B><P>Following early unsuccessful attempts with large-scale applicationsof modified harvesting systems, it became evident that the biologicalguidance for successful regeneration must be based on more detailedstudy of forest ecology. The approach used has been <B>biophysicalclassification</B>, that is, the classification of forest landon the basis of ground vegetation in relation to a nutrient andmoisture regime matrix. These regimes range from dry to wet andfrom poor to rich.<BR><P>The <B>ecosystems</B> are recognized as operational silviculturalgroups in the nutrient-moisture matrix. The matrices are set upfor large ecoregions or biogeoclimatic zones representing a recognizableregional relationship between forest cover, climate, and landform.The units recognized are described in terms of typical foresttypes and associated soil-profile characteristics. Managementinterpretations, limiting factors, and successional informationare also provided; thus, <B>a biological-classification framework,based on natural forest conditions, is the basis for silviculturalpractices</B>. Around the classifications are accumulated knowledgeand experience on silvicultural successes and failures and forest-productivityinformation. This knowledge base is thus called <B>site-specific</B>.It has been found to be an essential framework for silviculturalpractice.<BR><P><B><A NAME="canada">Silvicultural Systems used in Canada</A><BR></B><P>The planned program of silvicultural treatments during the lifeof a stand is a <B>silvicultural system.</B> The following silviculturalsystems are used in Canada.<UL><LI><B>clearcutting</B> systems, involving the removal of alltrees<p><LI><B>shelterwood </B>systems, involving the retention of anoverstory of mature trees while an understory of regenerationbecomes established; such an understory is called <B>advance growth</B>and often occurs naturally in old forests<p><LI><B>seed-tree</B> systems, involving the leaving of a selectednumber of individual or groups of trees of superior form togetherwith a receptive seedbed<p><LI><B>selection </B>systems, involving the maintenance of anuneven-aged and uneven-sized stand structure that is self-regeneratingand periodically harvested to remove a portion of the growingstock from trees of all size classes<p><LI><B>coppice</B> systems, involving clearcutting but relyingon the vegetative propagation of a new crop of trees from stumpsprouts or root suckers </UL><P>Each tree and plant species has particular reproduction and growthstrategies and characteristics, and this body of knowledge isknown as the <B>silvics</B> of the tree species.<BR><P>It is not biologically possible to secure both rapid and abundantnatural regeneration in many Canadian forest associations, evenwhen silvicultural systems are carefully prescribed. We continueto harvest large areas of very old over-mature forest that areoften composed of<B> climax species</B>, ill-adapted to rapidestablishment and growth on open cutovers. The extreme age andhigh incidence of decay and disease in old forests often mandateclearcutting. Clearcuts are initially not beautiful and are subjectto much public criticism. Planting such areas is usually requiredfor prompt regeneration. Large areas of poorly stocked cutoversof this type have accumulated in the absence of planting. Theyare known as <B>backlog </B>and are given high priority for artificialregeneration treatments. The mechanical preparation of improvedseedbeds, primarily designed to expose mineral soil and removevegetative competition, is called <B>scarification</B>. Scarificationtreatment is a common component of natural regeneration prescriptions.<BR><P><B><A NAME="natural">Securing Natural Regeneration</A><BR></B><P>All of Canada's forests originally developed from natural regenerationwithout human intervention. Fire, blowdown, and insect attackare the usual agencies for mortality of old timber. The tree speciesare adapted to regenerate after these disturbances. Harvestingof timber results in some critical changes to seedbed conditionsand seed supply that have no natural precedent.<BR><P>Observed conditions for natural regeneration are the basis forsilvicultural prescriptions.<P>These prescriptions are designed to provide appropriate seed supply,seedbed, and moisture and vegetative conditions that favor desiredtree species. For example, knowing how a forest stand can be madeto increase its timber yield is part of a silvicultural prescription.This increase can be achieved by<UL><LI>changing the stand density and structure.<p><LI>increasing the net balance of photosynthesis to respirationby crop trees and the forest stand as a whole.<p><LI>making genetic improvement in the tree species grown.<p><LI>using new or different species, strains, or races of treeson particular areas to give greater total wood production or improvedquality and stem form. </UL><P>Ways of changing forest site productivity to increase wood yieldscan also be part of a prescription for the forest. These include<UL><LI>restoring lost productivity of abused sites by protectionfrom fire, grazing, and abnormal erosion and by the use of speciesadapted to the soil and climate.<p><LI>improving the productivity of the site by cultivation, fertilizing,or irrigation.<p><LI>eliminating forest-floor vegetation that competes with treesand thus detracts from wood production. </UL><P>These ways of increasing wood yield are stand-level actions, thatis, actions taken to change the structure and dynamics of individualforest stands. Forests are composed of many individual stands,usually grouped into a forest management unit for planning purposes.Forest management involves actions at the level of the whole forestmanagement unit &Ucirc; protection; forest renewal and stand tending;determining the size, location, and scheduling of harvests; andmultiple-use planning.<BR><P><B><A NAME="artificial">Use of Artificial Regeneration</a></B><P>The decision to use artificial means to regenerate forests istaken where<UL><LI>natural regeneration cannot be reliably secured or is excessivelydense, of poor quality, diseased, or the wrong species.<p><LI>prompt regeneration is needed with simultaneous control ofspecies and density.<p><LI>the benefits of tree breeding and tree improvement are availablein improved nursery stock.<p><LI>matching species to site and/or planting an exotic specieswill result in significant gains in production. </UL><P>Since such circumstances are common, artificial regeneration hasexpanded greatly in the 1960-1990 period. Approximately one-thirdof current cutovers are planted.<BR><P><b>Use of artificial regeneration requires the following</b>:<P><B>1. Seed supply - </B>Seed collections must be made either fromnatural untreated stands, selected natural stands dedicated toseed production (seed production areas), or plantations of familiesof selected trees planted in orchards and subject to irrigationand fertilizing to induce flower production (first generationseed orchards). Following cross-pollination between families andprogeny, test seed orchards are rogued to leave orchards composedof trees of proven genetically superior performance (second generationseed orchards).<BR><P>Tree species vary in their seed production patterns and seed storageand germination requirements. Forest tree seed is usually labeledby seed zones and location and there are generally rules controllingthe use of seed outside its zone or elevation range.<BR><P>Forest tree seed is usually stored in large central seed banksunder refrigeration, with enough storage to provide many yearsof demand for each species. Some species and seed zones are inshort supply. Large amounts of first-generation seed-orchard seedwill not generally be available until at least the year 2000.<BR><P>Some species, notably black spruce and jack pine, produce largequantities of seed in cones stored on trees for many years. Collectionof their cones is easy, and this leads to large reserves of inexpensiveseed in storage. This seed is used in direct seeding, from aircraftor ground (for example, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles), usuallyon scarified cutovers. Direct seeding relies on large quantitiesof tree seed, and thus on inexpensive tree seed. For this reasondirect seeding is mainly limited to these two species. Cone collectionsare often made from trees felled in logging operations. Accessto cones in standing trees is gained through tree climbing, ladders,and lifting devices. <BR><P>Seed collected from different parts of the range of a tree speciesis tested for suitability at different locations in provenancetrials. Seed from certain provenances is in short supply. Someprovenances of British Columbia seed, notably Douglas-fir, Sitkaspruce, grand fir, and lodgepole pine, are famous or infamousin Europe for their superior or inferior characteristics. Historicallack of control over seed supply and subsequent poor plantationperformance gave rise to the current tight restrictions and governmentcontrol on seed collection and storage and allocation on Crownlands in Canada.<BR><P><B>2. Nursery practices</B> - Seedlots of species selected assuitable for specific forested sites are sent to forest nurseriesfor the production of planting stock. Originally, most plantingstock was produced in bare-root nurseries, where the seed wassown on raised beds, covered with protective grit or sand, grownfor one or two years, and then either outplanted in the forest,or transplanted in the nursery for a year or two to grow biggerbefore outplanting.<P>Currently, most nursery stock is raised in containers in greenhousesunder more controlled temperature and moisture conditions andis irrigated with standardized nutrient solutions. Container seedlingsgrow faster, are more uniform, and are often cheaper to produce;however, they are often less able to compete after outplantingthan bare-root stock. The stock type is usually ordered and customgrown one to three years in advance of outplanting. Current Canadianproduction is approaching one billion seedlings per year, grownin government and private nurseries. Much planting stock is heldin cold storage following lifting, then trucked various distancesto planting sites. Over 95% of the production is conifer, two-thirdspine and spruce species. There is a limited production of poplarraised from cuttings.<BR><P><B>3. Site preparation </B>- Physical disturbance of the forestfloor to create improved seedbeds for natural regeneration iscalled <B>scarification</B>. Site preparation practices are usedto make the task of planting easier and to aid plantation survivaland growth. <P>The practices consist of <UL><LI>the mechanical actions of ploughing, discing, trenching, crushing,and slash piling; <p><LI>the use of chemicals, usually herbicides, to kill or suppresscompeting vegetation; and<p><LI>prescribed burns to remove slash and woody debris, set backcompeting vegetation, provide ash as fertilizer, and increasenutrient mobilization and availability through increased soiltemperatures. </UL><P>Such site preparation techniques are often essential for plantationestablishment on richer sites, that is, very fertile soils proneto rapid brush and grass invasion. There has been rapid developmentof a wide variety of mechanized site-preparation equipment, aidedby the availability and development of specialized prime moversfor logging (wheeled skidders, specialized tracked tractors, andnew types of forwarders and backhoes).<P>The use of prescribed burning has expanded rapidly following thedevelopment of fire ignition systems from helicopters and thescientific calculation of burning indices, slash loadings, andrates of fire spread. Site-preparation practices are a particularnecessity in Canadian conifer silviculture because of the manyunusable small trees, rotten trees, and non-commercial trees inthe virgin old-growth forests that are being cut today; the needto improve soil temperatures in northern forests with thick humuslayers; vegetative competition on clearcut areas; and the largevolumes of slash.<BR><p><P><B>4. Planting methods </B>- Of all the silvicultural practices, the task of planting approximatelya billion trees per year is the least mechanized. Careful plantingon the appropriate microsite is very important; this can reallyonly be done well by hand, in spite of many expensive attemptsto develop mechanized planting machines. Over a million persondays of work per year are required. Manual planting is a majorsource of annual income to the reforestation contracting industry.<BR><P>Not only must seedlot and species be custom selected for eachplanting site, but so must the planting-stock type, that is, itsage, size, and whether it is bare-root or container, and if container,of what container size and type and whether the type is compatiblewith the treatment used.<BR><P>Planting is usually done in early spring following snowmelt andis subject to rigorous quality checks and inspections. Paymentis usually on a piecework basis. The work is physically demandingand is usually carried out by young people using tools such asplanting mattocks or shovels for bare-root stock or planting tubesfor container stock.<P><B>5. Vegetation management practices -</B> Experience has shownthat planting must be followed by tending practices to ensurefree-growing trees, that is, trees free enough of competitionand with adequate supply of moisture and nutrients to ensure continuedsurvival and height growth. Achievement of free-to-grow statusis a mandatory basic silvicultural requirement for licensees onCrown lands in some provinces. The objective of free-to-grow statusis to ensure a new forest crop of reliable and predictable standdevelopment, low in risk and with calculable dimensions, productvalues, and yields.<BR><P>Vegetation management practices include those of site preparationbefore and after planting and also following natural regenerationgermination. Release of trees from competing vegetation (weeds)uses:<UL><LI>chemical methods (usually selective herbicides with and withoutfertilizers), <p><LI>manual methods (hand slashing, pulling, and thinning withchain and brush saws), and<p><LI>biological methods (cattle, sheep, goat, and deer grazing).</UL><p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_19th.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_19th.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_silvi2.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_silvi2.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
