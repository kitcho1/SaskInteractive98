Let's take a look at the development of the forestryindustry, by traveling backward in time to revisit the industryas it was more than a century ago. <BR><P><B><A NAME="19th">Work in the Nineteenth-Century Forest Industry</A></B><P>Covering a large part of the country, the forest has played amajor role in the lives of the inhabitants of Canada:<P><UL><LI>Indians used its wood for shelter, and for making containers,tools and means of transportation. <p><LI>The forest is the home of many different animals that thenative people hunted in order to feed and clothe themselves.<p><LI>The French, who settled in this country during the seventeenthand eighteenth centuries, relied on the forest to provide thefurs needed to support the colony's principal source of economy- the fur trade. At this time, wood was exported only on a smallscale; it mainly served local needs in shipbuilding, the constructionof homes and heating. </UL><P>The early part of the nineteenth century saw the decline of thefur trade and the beginning of a more intensive exploitation ofthe forest. Great Britain had been at war with France since 1793and was in need of wood to rebuild her merchant marine and navy.As she was not able to supply her shipyards with pine and oakfrom regions near the Baltic Sea, due to a blockade, she turnedto the forests of her North American colonies. For more than halfa century, woodsmen entered the forests of Lower and Upper Canada(Quebec and Ontario), New Brunswick and even Maine in search ofpine and oak. Usually the felled timber was <B>hewn </B>(shapewith sharp instrument) on site, and the name given to the process,"squaring," reflects the characteristic shape it eventuallytook. This demand for square timber, coupled with bad forestrypractices, had a detrimental effect on the tree species involved.The pine tree disappeared from New Brunswick around 1860 and fromthe Ottawa Valley at the end of the nineteenth century.<P>In addition to square timber (pine and oak), Canada produced boards,beams and parts for casks for the domestic and export markets.Shipbuilding developed in Canada in tandem with the growth of thewood trade, thus making it possible to hire thousands of shipwrightsand giving birth to many <B>secondary industries</B> or stimulatingtheir growth.<P>As Britain's demand for square timber began to fall off aroundthe middle of the nineteenth century, the Canadian forest industryfound a new outlet for its products in the form of sawtimber -a demand created by the growth of cities in the United Statesand Canada. This market eased some of the stress on the maturepine and oak stands, for beams and boards could be made from smallertrees and from other species such as spruce.<P>Lumber entrepreneurs penetrated into new areas. Many small sawmills were built at the mouths of rivers,and in 1851, Canada West had more than 1500 of them, Canada East(Ontario and Quebec) about 1000 and New Brunswick nearly 600.Some of them expanded and employed as many as 500 men around 1871.<P>At the end of the nineteenth century, technical progress introducednew materials such as brick, iron and steel into competition withsawtimber. However, just as the demand for lumber on the internationalmarket began to diminish, the market for pulp and paper increased.<P>Obviously, the first enterprises in this area were modest, producingmainly wood pulp, which was shippped in its raw state to be processedin the United States and Great Britain. However, after 1910 thespread of the sensationalist press and the development of advertisingin the United States upped the demand for newsprint. In Canada,producers decided to make their own paper and built new papermills, which by around 1920, were supplying about 80 percent ofNorth American requirements.<P>Even today, the wood industry plays a key role in the Canadianeconomy, second only to agriculture in importance. The westernpart of the country, especially British Columbia, often outproducesthe east, where forest resources are becoming rapidly exhausted,partly because new technology favours less selective cutting,and partly because reforestation is only a recent phenomenon andits benefits cannot yet be realized.<P><B><A NAME="force">Work Force</A> </B><P>The wood industry throughout the nineteenth century was quitelabour intensive, since numerous steps were required to transforma tree into a finished product. In addition to the workers (shantymen)involved in cutting and transporting the logs, there were alsothe sawmill workers and the artisans, and as thewood industry became more mechanized, the factory workers.<P><B><A NAME="shantymen">The Shantymen</A></B><UL><LI>Description - Although there had been workers in the forestindustry since the early days of New France, it was not untilthe nineteenth century that their role took on considerable importance.The romantic idea of the lumberjack frequently to be found inliterature and legend is well known; the reality, however, wasdifferent. Recruited from among the immigrants and settlers orfrom day labourers and farmers in search of extra wages, the lumberjackswould "go up to the shanty" around mid-October and manywould not return until the end of spring. <p><LI>Living Conditions - Their camp often consisted only of a logcabin containing a single room crammed on all sides with bunks.In the centre there would be an open fire, which was replacedby a stove by the end of the century. The number of shantymenin a camp might vary from ten with a small outfit to more thansixty and even eighty with large companies at the end of the century.<p><LI>The Typical Work Day - The days were long; at six in the morning,the lumberjacks went to the felling areas; often up earlier werethe teamsters who carted away the timber and who had to feed,water and harness the horses or oxen before breakfast. There weremore men on <B>square timber crews</B> than on <B>sawtimber gangs</B>,because squaring timber also required notching and <B>hewing</B>after the tree had been felled, two functions demanding definiteskills and experience. After the timber had been squared or thelogs trimmed, the <B>skidders</B> took over. Using a team of horsesor oxen, they dragged the "sticks" or logs to the rollway,which was located near a road; from there the wood was taken bycart to the landing on the river. Around six in the evening, thelumberjacks returned to the camp, whereas the teamsters seldomfinished their day's work before eight. The work went on likethis six days a week until the ice melted, signalling the beginningof the "drive" - the time at which logs were floateddownriver. Some of the shantymen then became drivers, and othersreturned home or went to work in the sawmills, which went intoproduction as soon as the rivers opened up. The drivers' workwas often dangerous, especially when jams occurred and they hadto work in the water. Unlike in the bush, men on the drive hadto keep changing their encampment as they followed the logs downstream.<p><LI>Wages - Not much is known about the wages of the forest workersof the nineteenth century, aside from the fact that they werepaid monthly and that wages varied only slightly from one regionto another and considerably from one trade to another. In 1850,for example, in the Trent River valley in Canada West, a workerwho notched and hewed wood into square timber received doublethe wage of one who simply felled and trimmed the trees. The monthlywage was usually calculated on the basis of twenty-six workingdays, from which were subtracted the days lost because of sickness,injury or bad weather. Purchases of such items as tea, tobaccoand tools from the company store were also deducted from the worker'spay. It could thus happen that earnings of $40 for four months'work would be reduced to $10, and some lumbermen even found themselvesin debt to the company upon completion of their contract of severalmonths. If such cases were frequent, one wonders what drove thesemen up to the shanty.<p><LI>Meals - Throughout the nineteenth century, the food was extremelyfrugal; around 1850, for example, shanty men often had to be satisfiedwith hardtack or Boston crackers, baked beans, pea soup, saltpork, lard, pork, and of course the fish and game they were sometimesable to catch in the area. As a rule, vegetables, sugar, molassesand pastry did not appear on the menu until the end of the century.<p><LI>Recreation - The evenings were short, and entertainment waslimited to songs and stories, and to games emphasizing skill andphysical strength. Sundays were reserved for washing and groomingand for repairing and maintaining the equipment. One can easilyimagine that during the months of isolation these men keenly missedtheir loved ones. Indeed, there were no women in the camps, exceptin the case of very small outfits, where they performed the dutiesof "mother" and cook.<p><LI>Consequences of Working in the Bush - Because they workedin small scattered groups far from the population centres andfor only a few months a year, the shanty men did not participatein the union movement, which was developing and asserting itselfin the nineteenth century. Their demands thus found other meansof expression. It may well be that the desertions, days of absenceand sickness, and the consumption of alcohol were their ways ofreacting to the bad working conditions. </UL><P><B><A NAME="sawmill">The Sawmill Workers</A></B><UL><LI>Description - The mills were running by six in the morningand did not stop until six in the evening; the workers had scarcelyan hour for eating at noon. In the small sawmills of the firsthalf of the nineteenth century, work was seasonal - the millsoperated mainly in the spring and the fall, taking advantage ofthe flow of the rivers swollen by melted snow and rain. Sincemost sawmills were equipped with only one or two vertical saws,they employed only a few workers who carried out several operations,such as selecting the logs, transporting them from the river tothe mill and sawing them.<p><LI>Technological Advances - Working conditions changed around1840, when major technological innovations transformed some millsinto veritable factories. The use of turbines and steam lengthenedthe work season and stepped up the work pace. The introductionof circular saws and the increase in the number of vertical sawsnot only made it possible to improve production, but also madeit necessary to concentrate workers in one place. This inevitablyled to the division of the work into many small precisely definedtasks that had to be done at a regular rhythm, interrupted onlyby mechanical breakdown.<p><LI>Employment Opportunities - Some mills employed as many as500 men, and it is said that it 1870, the six sawmills of theChaudiere River, Quebec, kept 4 000 men busy. To ensure a readysupply of manpower, some mill owners created whole villages bypurchasing land in the vicinity of their mills and building houseswhich they rented to their employees. <p><LI>Wages - Wages were paid not in money, but in tokens or vouchersthat could only be exchanged at the company store. If an employeewanted to exchange a voucher or token for cash in order to buygoods elsewhere, he then lost 10 per cent of its value. Becausethe mill workers were paid only at the end of the month, familiesthat were at all large had trouble making ends meet without goinginto debt. </UL><P><B><A NAME="artisans">The Artisans</A></B><UL><LI>Description - Artisans who worked with wood were the largestgroup of tradespeople in the nineteenth century. <B>Carpenters</B>and<B> joiners</B> were busy building houses, barns and sheds;<B>shipwrights</B> worked at schooners, longboats and other typesof vessels; <B>cartwrights</B> built coaches, carriages and carts;<B>coopers</B> made casks of all sizes; joiners<B> </B>workedat making furniture. Finally, <B>sculptors</B> produced worksas varied as figureheads and church statues.<p><LI>Skilled Workers - In contrast to the forest and sawmill workers,craftsmen had to undergo a formal apprenticeship, which lastedon the average a little more than three years. The custom of apprenticeshipwas brought to North America by the Europeans in the seventeenthcentury and persisted into the twentieth, although not withoutadaptations and transformations. The transformations, which affectedthe working conditions of the craftsmen, were directly connectedwith the organization of production and labour.<p><LI>Work Place - Until the beginning of the nineteenth centuryin the cities and towns, and until much later in some rural regions,small-scale organization of production and labour prevailed. Themanufacture of an article was the work of one artisan, eithera master craftsman or a journeyman, who carried out every step,sometimes with the help of apprentices. He usually worked in asmall shop, which was often attached to his dwelling, and he ownedhis own tools, which had changed but little over the centuries.The work was usually done to order. The major sources of energywere muscle power and water power, and the hand tool was stillthe principal means of shaping the raw material. Control of allstages of manufacture enabled the artisan to identify with hiswork and gave meaning to his activity. Under such a system, thework was defined more by close personal relationships and reciprocalrights and duties than by supply and demand, as later became thecase. There were conflicts none the less. It must be borne inmind that the craftsmen worked six days a week and that the workdaylasted from twelve to fifteen hours, depending on the trade andthe season.<p><LI>Change in Production - Around 1830, a number of master craftsmenbecame retailer-manufacturers or small contractors and changedtheir mode of production to satisfy a growing local market andto compete with imported products. They mass produced and thensold by advertising. Some of them brought together a number ofcraftsmen under one roof, used machine tools, and divided thework into several tasks; they were thus able to employ unskilledworkers. Apprentices were hired at a younger age and were retainedlonger so that maximum benefit could be derived from cheap labour.The traditional responsibilities of master craftsmen toward theirapprentices (training, room and board, and moral and religiouseducation) gradually became blurred and were replaced by a wagein money.<p><LI>Unified Work Force - The changes observed in the largest operationsprovoked considerable opposition on the part of the artisans,who feared unemployment and the degradation of their trade. Thisopposition manifested itself in the founding of associations,in disputes and even in strikes. Of course, strikes occurred firstin sectors where there was a concentration of workers, such asshipbuilding and the construction industry. Demands first centredon wages, working hours and dismissals, and then were graduallyextended to human relations, to mechanization and to the acceptanceof unions, which was not won until 1872. </UL><P><B><A NAME="factory">The Factory Workers</A></B><UL><LI>Industrialization - After 1860, the use of the steam enginespread, and the manual work of the artisan took second place tomechanized work. The workers became subject to the machine, whichimposed its rhythm on them; the autonomy characteristic of theartisan's work ceased to exist. This process of industrializationwas accelerated by the introduction at the turn of the centuryof the gas engine and then the electric motor, which became moreaccessible to small firms. <p><LI>The Work Place - Working conditions in these factories wereusually poor, since the workers were subject to the rule of theforeman, who obeyed only the regulations issued by the owners.Mechanization forced craftsmen to repeat the same operation ina constant rhythm to produce a standard product. Since the unionswere still relatively weak, dismissals, fines for lateness anddelayed payment of wages were common practices. The work weekwas sixty hours or more, and wages were hardly enough for an averagefamily to live decently. Thus women and children often had towork so that the family could make ends meet. It is easy to imaginethe misery that resulted when a breadwinner lost his job in anera that knew no social security of any kind, neither workmen'scompensation nor unemployment insurance. </UL><P>All trades, however, were not affected at the same time and atthe same rate by this final stage of the industrial revolution.Construction workers, for example, by virtue of their direct actionon the raw material, were among the few craftsmen to retain controlof their work.<P><B><A NAME="past">Past to Present</A></B><P>In summary, the Canadian Forest Industry began development inresponse to the demands of the British navy for long, square timbers.A lot of the wood cut had defects and could not be used and asa result, much of the wood was wasted. A period followed whenpeople demanded only knot_free pine and spruce lumber. This meantonly the best pine and spruce trees were cut, and only some ofthese were used. When pulpwood logging began, spruce, balsam andjackpine trees were cut and only smaller trees were used. Thedemand for lumber also meant a demand for workers in various areasof the industry.<P>The forest industry continues to develop and change. Today, alltree species are cut. Almost no wood is left in the bush; largelogs are sent to sawmills for lumber and veneer and small logsare sent to pulp and paper mills. The waste from the trees isoften used as biomass fuel. Areas of felled trees are replantedor reforested helping to ensure success of the forest for futuregenerations and for the forest industry itself.<P>The forest industry remains a predominant sector in Canada's economy,directly providing 300,000 jobs and indirectly providing some700,000 more. However, it still faces two dangers which have threatenedit in the past: <P>1. Excessive dependence on foreign markets and foreign capital<P>The era of square timber and of shipbuilding was the era of theBritish, the era of sawtimber was the era of the Americans andsecondarily of the British, and the present era, that of pulpand paper, is dominated by American capital. The development ofthe forest resources of eastern Canada has therefore been determinedto a considerable extent by decisions taken abroad. Productionhas often been subject to the vagaries of international trade.<P>2. The exhaustion of resources<P>The main threat to the forest industry continues to be the exhaustionof resources. Subject to no control, entrepreneurs long consideredonly their immediate profit, giving no thought to the future.Even in 1889, the pamphleteer Arthur Buies raised the alarm aboutthis waste of resources: Until now, many lumber merchants havepractised not intelligent industry, but devastation of the forests,veritable pillaging, the blind, brutal, furious exterminationof some of the most beautiful species of wood in the world.<P>It was not until the middle of the twentieth century, when forestexploitation shifted to western Canada, that conservation andreforestation policies came into being.	<p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./history_chro.html">		<A HREF="./history_chro.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./technology.html">		<A HREF="./technology.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
