It is usually done manually using brushand chain saws or mechanically with tractor-mounted flails orsaws. PCT homogenizes the stand, increases mean tree size, andlowers the age at which the stand can be harvested. The practiceis difficult to mechanize and is very expensive; more than oneperson-day per hectare is commonly required. In spite of its highcost, this practice is common. Accelerated harvest of youngerstands often allows for accelerated harvest of older overmaturestands in a forest management unit, thus yielding more than enoughrevenue to pay for a PCT program. PCT also reduces logging costsand increases product values. Wildlife habitat and landscape valuesare often improved. Without PCT treatment, stands on lower-fertilitysites may never be operable. Stands may be left at final cropdensity or may be designed to allow for one or more commercialthinnings.<BR><P>The practice is called pre-commercial since it is done shortlyafter crown closure, the time at which the available crown spacehas become fully occupied. The trees are relatively small andthere is no market for the cut trees.<P><B><A NAME="thinning">Commercial Thinning (CT)</A></B><P>Up to 30% of the total volume production in a stand can be lostdue to competition-induced mortality (smaller trees in dense standsdie because there is not enough growing space for all of them).Commercial thinning attempts to recover this mortality loss andto provide early income from a stand by harvesting trees big enoughto have product value. In practice, it is almost impossible torecover all potential loss through mortality because repeatedlight thinnings are necessary if residual stand volumes sufficientto maintain stand growth rates are left after each thinning.<BR><P>Because of present Canadian market conditions and the high loggingcost of thinnings, most of the repeated light thinnings desiredare unmarketable and too expensive; even a single thinning maynot be economical. Commercial thinnings are more likely to beeconomical if the stand has had density control at establishmentor by subsequent precommercial thinnings. Currently, very littlecommercial thinning is done in Canada, primarily due to unsuitablestand densities and species, high logging costs, and low stumpagevalues.<BR><P><B>Pruning and Shearing </B><P>After stands have been reduced in density to the point where valuablefinal crop trees can be identified at an early age, pruning ispossible. Pruning increases the value of individual trees by prematurelyremoving the lower branches so that clear wood, free of knots,is laid down around an unpruned knotty core. Several valuabletree species have branches that do not rot off readily and remainpersistently on the tree even after death due to shading.<BR><P>Dead and live branches are cut off flush with the trunk usingmanual handsaws; mechanization is very difficult. Repeated pruningsare needed to maintain a cylindrical knotty core and yet not removetoo much live crown. <BR><P>Pruning is very expensive; for it to be economical the increasein stumpage value of clear timber over knotty timber must be greatand the stand must have been thinned. Since these conditions arerare in Canada, pruning is little practiced. As more and morePCT-treated stands accumulate and as supplies of clear old-growthtimber diminish, pruning will become more economically attractive.The practice requires a 20- or 30-year lead time before clearwood in sufficient quantities is produced by a tree. The mostcommon species pruned are white pine and Douglas fir.<BR><P>Shearing is the practice used in Christmas tree culture: a shapingof the form of the tree to make it more salable. It is usuallydone with sharp knife blades. Pine trees are treated while incandle, that is, while the leaders are growing. Other conifersare treated after bud formation.<BR><P><B><A NAME="tsi">Timber Stand Improvement (TSI)</A></B><P>Timber stand improvement&Ucirc;cutting down or poisoning all deformedand unwanted trees within older stands&Ucirc;is usually done inpreviously untended hardwood stands containing valuable treesmixed with less valuable ones. It is usually a noncommercial practice,in that no revenue is generated, although some fuelwood may beproduced. The objective is to concentrate the growing capacityof the site on the most valuable trees, without excessive growing-stockreduction and loss of growth. Eastern Canada has very extensiveareas of tolerant hardwood forests, often previously subjectedto cuttings that removed the most valuable trees and left theleast valuable. Such stands are of low quality and should be treatedby TSI practices. Currently, TSI is little practiced because ofthe high cost and lack of immediate return.<BR><P><B>Fertilizing and Drainage</B><P>The growth rates of individual trees and stands can be increasedby providing additional supplies of limiting nutrient elements.In contrast to agricultural crops, forest ecosystems recycle nutrients;however, many forest stands are mainly limited by their nutrientsupply, rather than by their climate, temperature, or moistureregime.<BR><P>Granular fertilizers are spread by helicopter on designated foreststands, an expensive practice. Because of the high cost of theextra fertilizer-grown wood, the fertilized trees must be finalcrop (the stand thinned to final crop density) and the stumpagevalues high. In addition, there may need to be a shortage of standvolumes in certain forest age classes in a management unit. Itis essential that the forest stand be known to be responsive tosuch treatment.<BR><P>Most stands are fertilized after crown closure, usually at finalcrop density. Some fertilizing at the time of planting or immediatelyafter planting is also done. To be successful, vegetation managementis required, together with accurate diagnostic tests of regenerationnutrient status.<BR><P>Drainage of forest sites, especially organic soils, has a greatpotential to improve stand growth. Although it is widely practicedin the boreal forests of Finland, where timber and growing sitesare in short supply, it is used only experimentally in Canada,usually in black spruce muskeg conditions. The practice requireslarge forest ploughs or specially designed backhoes. The distanceand depth of drainage ditches must be carefully matched to theorganic matter classification and hydrological characteristics.<BR><P><B><A NAME="special">Special Silvicultural Practices</A><BR></B><P>Most of the previous intensive silvicultural practices are usedto enhance timber production. In addition, there are culturalpractices designed to attain other objectives.<BR><P><B>Seed Orchard Management</B><P>Designed to maximize cone production, the practices involved inseed orchard management are drainage to control soil moisture;standpipe mist irrigation to delay bud formation until local pollensources have gone; repeated nitrogen fertilizing and basal scarringto stimulate female flower bud formation; radical top shearingfor convenience of cone picking; and cross-pollination breedingand progeny testing followed by roguing.<BR><P><B>Nursery Management</B><P>These techniques are not considered silvicultural practices. Theyare numerous and complex and many are considered to be more horticulturethan silviculture.<BR><P><B>Recreation and Landscape Silviculture</B><P>TSI, PCT, and CT and vegetation management practices are appliedto meet the needs of tourist campers, hikers, and motorists inparks, recreation areas, and commercial timber forests. Landscapedesign criteria often require a major modification of the cut-blocklayout and influence the choice of silvicultural system and evenof species for planting. Pruning of trees along roadsides in forestsprovides views into stands. Forests stands are deliberately manipulatedby silvicultural practices to improve wildlife habitat. Stand-levelpractices include PCT, CT, and fertilizing to encourage understoryforage production; use of selection silvicultural systems alongstreams and rivers to protect riparian habitat and keep watertemperatures cool; and the retention of snags, dead trees, andwolf trees for nesting. Cutovers, forest meadows, and stands areset on fire to create forage and set back succession. Grass seedingis a common practice on cutovers on open-range situations in westernCanada where cattle graze.<P><B><A NAME="surveys">Silvicultural Surveys and Stand-History Record Keeping</A></B><P>One of the essential features of forestry practice is the planningof silvicultural actions in a way that meets the owners' standmanagement objectives. Planning requires excellent record keepingand monitoring of stand performance by surveys. Silviculturalsurvey practices include those of regeneration and backlog assessmentsurveys, plantation surveys, and free-to-grow surveys. All dataare entered into stand-history record keeping systems, which arein turn components of forest inventory and planning systems.<P>Silvicultural surveys of every cutover area are required duringa 10 to 40-year period until the new stand has reached crown closure.This means an annual workload of 1-3 million hectares of silviculturalsurveys in Canada. These surveys involve fieldwork or the useof remote-sensing techniques. Fieldwork varies from field walk-throughsto the sampling of numerous small, temporary and permanent plotsestablished in grid patterns on cutover areas. The plots are measuredfor species frequency; tree density and height; occurrence ofinsect, disease, and other damage; and competing brush invasion.<BR><P>Since most commercial forest land in Canada is under lease fortimber harvesting with a legal obligation for successful regenerationor free-to-grow status, the silvicultural surveys represent inspectionsof performance. Such inspections are done by provincially licensedor approved silvicultural surveyors in some provinces.<BR><P>Stand-history record-keeping practices are usually computer-basedstorage and retrieval systems on a stand-by-stand basis. Thesesystems are often linked to a geographic information system (GIS)and a broader total forest inventory and planning system. Suchsystems are maintained and developed by both corporate licenseesand provincial governments. Canada has no national system of stand-historyrecord keeping.<BR><P><B><A NAME="prescriptions">Preparation of Silvicultural Prescriptions</A></B><P>The final major field of silvicultural practices, apart from thebusiness and legal components of silvicultural contracting isthat of preparing silvicultural prescriptions.<BR><P>This silvicultural practice involves assessing the stand for growingstock, stand structure, species composition, fertility and moistureregime, amount of regeneration, seedbed and seed supply situation,brush invasion, and landscape, recreation, and wildlife habitatvalues; planning stand establishment and crop tending; writinga detailed prescription; implementing and monitoring the plannedactions at the stand level; and determining the impact on forest-levelobjectives. Such formal analyses and prescriptions are mandatoryin some provinces for every cutover area and must be signed bya professional forester (thousands are required every year). Theyhave become necessary because of controversies over the use offorests for multiple purposes, such as timber, recreation, wildlife,landscape scenery, and nature conservation, and because the biologicalvariation and complexity of forests do not allow for standardizedsuccessful treatments.<BR><P>The stand inventory is related to various feasible stand managementalternatives that meet landowners' objectives and are economical.The best prescription is chosen and a detailed year-by-year planof implementation is designed with recommendations on costs anddetails of procedure. The whole procedure is similar to the workdone by engineers and architects in design work. The preparationand implementation of a successful silvicultural prescriptionis the ultimate test of the professionalism and ability of a Canadiansilviculturist.<BR><P><FONT SIZE=2>Adapted from publication</FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>preparedby Dr. G.
