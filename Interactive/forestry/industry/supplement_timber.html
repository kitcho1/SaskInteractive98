Trees provide shelter, food, wildlife habitat, medicinesand fuel.  They supply the raw materials for the production ofpaper products, lumber, tools and household goods.<BR><P>As a forest products company, Weyerhaeuser Canada's futuredepends on the health of our forests and our environment.  Atour forestry unit, <b>Saskatchewan Timberlands</b>, we make it our businessto be responsible users and resourceful managers of the province'sforests.<p>Our forests are a source of business, of scenic beauty and a naturalsetting for a range of recreational activities.  Most of all,our forests contribute to the health of the earth's environment.<P>The future of such a precious resource demands responsible action. We must ensure that our forests will be there for the next generation,and the next.<P><P><B><A NAME="responsibility">Your Forests, Our Responsibility</A>.<BR></B><P>Weyerhaeuser's Saskatchewan Timberlands is responsiblefor managing the company's forest activities under theForest Management License Agreement (FMLA), a written contract between the province of Saskatchewanand Weyerhaeuser Canada.  At Timberlands, foresters, technicians,biologists and support staff use their resources to works as ateam in planning, organizing and directing contractors, cooperatingwith government agencies and other forest users -- and puttingour operating plans into action.<P>Travel across Saskatchewan and you discover rich forest land thatbelongs to you --  the public. On your behalf, publiclyowned forests are administered by the Saskatchewan Governmentto ensure that proper care is taken of your resource.  WeyerhaeuserCanada shares in that responsibility too, through a Forest ManagementLicense Agreement (FMLA).<P>This 20-year agreement gives Weyerhaeuser the right to harvesttimber on an area of Northern Saskatchewan's forested landfor its sawmill in Big River and its pulp and paper mill in PrinceAlbert.  The agreement also states that Weyerhaeuser must ensurethat harvesting is at sustainable levels, and that all harvestedareas are reforested.  As long as the company meets its forestmanagement obligations, the FMLA can be extended in five-yearcycles.<P>In return, Weyerhaeuser pays the province an annual royalty or<B>stumpage </B>fee of about $1 million.  Each year, we must alsoset aside additional funds of about $3 million to cover the costof reforestation and other silvicultural programs.  Both payments are based on the volumeof trees harvested each year.<P>All of Weyerhaeuser's forest activities must be approvedin advance by Saskatchewan's Department of Environmentand Resource Management.  With input from the public, other forestusers and stakeholders, we develop an annual operating plan that'sreviewed and approved by the province.  We have also drawn upa 20-year Forest Management Plan that outlines our long term strategiesuntil the year 2010.<BR><P><B><A NAME="planning">Planning For The Future</A><BR></B><P>Advances in computer technology have played an important role improving forest management planning. A computer <B>geographic information system (GIS)</B> helps Timberlandsplanners track, analyze, manage and map all harvesting, reforestationand forest growth information.  It's also a modeling toolthat projects the impact of today's activities on futureforest growth for timber, wildlife, heritage and other values. At the same time, the GIS system can be used as a monitor.  Thesystem can track other forest users and their use of the resourcefor recreation.<P><B><A NAME="manage">The Forests We Manage</A><BR></B><P>In Saskatchewan, about one-third of our total land base is coveredwith forests.  Part of Canada's Boreal Forest, our region'snative species include a mixture of coniferous trees such as whiteand black spruce, jack pine, tamarack and balsam fir.  Deciduoustrees like aspen, black poplar and white birch also grow in theregion.  More than half of the total forest area is not commerciallyproductive.<P>Weyerhaeuser's FMLA area represents about one-sixth ofthe province's forest area.  Besides a 3.4 million-hectarearea allocated for current use, there is also a 1.6 million-hectarereserve for possible future use by our company.  About 55 percentof the FMLA area will remain in its natural state since it'snot commercially productive forest.  Except for possible constructionof winter access roads, this area will be left undisturbed.<P>We focus our forest management efforts on the remaining 45 percent,or 1.5 million hectares of commercial productive forest in ourFMLA area.  Here, we annually harvest sawlogs and pulpwood fromless than 6 000 hectares in small patches spread across the FMLA,or less than half of one per cent of the FMLA area's productiveforest.  Our silviculture program's goal is to reforestcutover areas within two years of harvest.<P>The average life cycle of the tree species in Saskatchewan'sBoreal Forest ranges from 80 to 120 years.  Trees die from oldage, disease, insects or fire.  In fact, for centuries, the region'sforest has been renewed by natural regeneration following wildfire. The result: a predominantly even-aged forest.<P>In response to the public's demand for lumber, paper andother wood products from the forest industry, governments haveimproved fire prevention and suppression programs.  The reductionof wild fires as a major element of the natural forest life cycleis partially offset by commercial harvesting and reforestationactivities.<P><B><A NAME="ifm">Integrated Forest Management</A><BR></B><P>With close to $1 Billion invested in our Saskatchewan manufacturingfacilities, Weyerhaeuser Canada is committed to building a successfulfuture in this province.<P>Healthy forests are a vital ingredient in our future.  By recognizingthe value of forests for the environment, wildlife, recreationaluse, First Nations People, industry, trappers, fishermen and outfitters,Timberlands Foresters design balanced and integrated forest managementplans that work to meet the needs of all forest users.  Throughcareful planning, we can ensure a healthy and sustainable futurefor one of our most valuable resources.<P><B><A NAME="harvesting">Harvesting Our Resources</A><BR></B><P>With long term planning and sound forestry practices, our forestersensure that Saskatchewan's forests continue to be a healthyand productive resource.  At the same time, Timberlands is creatingbusiness opportunities and jobs in the local area.  About 50 locallogging, trucking and silvicultural contractors work with Timberlands. In turn, these contractors employ about 300 people from communitiesin north and central Saskatchewan.<P>Timberland's annual harvest takes place at many sites acrossthe FMLA area.  Every year, about two million cubic metres oftimber is used for lumber, pulp and paper production at the company'sBig River sawmill and its pulp and paper mill in Prince Albert. About 60 per cent of the timber supply for sawlogs and pulpwoodis harvested from the FMLA area, while the rest is purchased fromindependent operators and private landowners.  The purchased fibreincludes residual chips from area sawmills, transforming a wasteproduct into valuable fibre used at our pulp mill.<P>Timberlands foresters must develop an annual operating plan basedon objectives established for each area of the forest to be harvested. This includes timber requirements, stand age, health, wildlifehabitat, aesthetic and recreational values, and the interestsof other traditional and commercial forest users.  After all theneeds and objectives are considered, foresters choose the harvestingmethod and reforestation prescription that suits each area thebest.<P><B><A NAME="clear">Clearcutting</A><BR></B><P>In Saskatchewan's forests, most stands of trees have regeneratednaturally after a fire and are described as<B> even aged</B>. The ecology of the prevalent tree species is such that they regenerateand grow best when not shaded by other trees.  That's whyclearcutting is often the preferred harvesting method in thisarea.  It creates open, sunny spaces where naturally regeneratedand planted trees grow best.  Shrubs and berry bushes, an importantsource of food for wildlife, also thrive in this environment.<P>When all timber is to be used, clearcutting is the most efficientand economical way to harvest.  It reduces the amount of timethe forest is disturbed between harvesting and reforestation activities,and decreases reforestation costs by encouraging natural renewal. It also minimizes the number and lengths of roads required forharvesting activities.<P>But like the aftermath of a wildfire, a clear-cut area is unsightlyfor the first few years following a harvest.  However, forestrenewal begins almost immediately.  In areas where there isn'tan adequate supply of natural seed cones, our foresters prescribesite preparation and tree planting within two years of harvestingto regenerate spruce or pine.  Harvested areas of aspen, poplaror birch regenerate naturally, sprouting from roots or stumps.<P>If you're unfamiliar with forest practices, the new growthof a cutover area may not be obvious for several years, especiallywhen you're driving by in your car.  But the harvestedtrees will soon be replaced.  A diverse, healthy and growing newforest will be visible within five to ten years.<P>To minimize the visual impact of clearcutting and its effect onwildlife habitat, Timberlands foresters carefully design the design,shape, location and patterns of cutover areas.  This ensures thatwildlife have the necessary cover to move from one area to thenext, as well as access to new growth in open areas.<P><B><A NAME="selective">Selective Cutting</A><BR></B><P>With selective cutting, foresters can select a specific tree speciesor tree size that they wish to remove from a forest area.  Thismethod is used in sensitive soil areas and on sites susceptibleto soil erosion.  It's used in <B>buffer </B>zones alongthe shores of lakes and streams, designed to protect water quality,fish and other aquatic life.  Selective cutting may also be usedas a regenerative practice for species like white spruce thatdo not require direct sunlight to grow. However, selective cuttingisn't the best method to regenerate healthy new growthin our predominantly even-aged forest stands.  This is especiallytrue for the tree species that do not grow well in the shade ofother trees, like jack pine and aspen.<P><B>It's in Our Nature to Be Resourceful<BR></B><P>As responsible forest managers, Weyerhaeuser foresters are alwayslooking for ways to improve their performance because the healthof the future forest is in the company's future.<P>Existing practices are constantly being challenged and modifiedto integrate ecological and other environmental concerns, andreduce the impact of harvesting and reforestation on the localecosystem.  It's an ongoing process that helps us improveour knowledge of the forest and the effectiveness of our practices.<P><B><A NAME="future">Our Future Resources</A><BR></B><P>In 1967, harvesting began to supply the pulp mill near PrinceAlbert.  By 1993, more than 50 million tree seedlings had beenplanted.<P>We estimate that about 4 million coniferous trees are harvestedannually on our FMLA.  In recent years, Weyerhaeuser'sannual coniferous tree planting program has exceeded five to sixmillion spruce and pine seedlings.  Virtually all of the deciduousforest species, like aspen, regenerate naturally.<P>Our obligation:  to maintain the long term sustained yield andhealth of the forests we manage.  Natural regeneration, combinedwith our ongoing tree improvement and planting programs, is ensuringthat this obligation is being met and even exceeded at an annualcost of more than $3 million.<P>We're confident that our use of Saskatchewan's forestsis well within a sustainable level.<P><B><A NAME="renewal">We Prescribe Renewal</A><BR></B><P>Just as harvesting methods are modified for specific areas, forestersdevelop customized silviculture <B>prescriptions </B>for harvestedsites.  Foresters prescribe forest renewal by natural regeneration,by mechanically preparing sites and replanting by hand - or acombination of methods.  Much depends upon the site's originaltree species.  Aspen trees naturally regenerate from root suckersin the sunny open space of a clear-cut.  Conifers such as blackspruce and jack pine usually regenerate naturally while whitespruce is normally regenerated by planting.  If an area doesn'thave an adequate seed source, seedlings will be planted usuallywithin two years after harvest.<P>About 95 per cent of tree seedlings survive the initial year ofgrowth.  After five years, regeneration surveys show that at least85 per cent of the trees become part of a healthy new forest.<P>To ensure that a new forest is growing, Timberlands forestersregularly carry out regeneration surveys to evaluate success ratesor identify problems.  Where undergrowth or other tree speciesare competing for space, foresters also clean and thin areas,giving the new forest a chance to grow.<P><B><A NAME="tops">Growing the Tops in Trees</A><BR></B><P>About 35 kilometres northeast of Prince Albert, Timberlands operatesa seed orchard and research greenhouse, the headquarters for Weyerhaeuser'stree improvement program in Saskatchewan.<P>Established in 1977, the program's goal is to improve thequality of trees in Weyerhaeuser's reforestation program. By carefully searching Saskatchewan's northern forests,foresters have found trees with superior characteristics in growth,form, and wood quality.  Cones and grafting materials have beentaken from these trees and used to produce new generations oftrees grown at the orchard, as well as in forest test plots andselected harvest areas.<P>Tree improvement staff regularly monitor the growth of the selectedtrees, choosing the best of the new generations to produce thenext crop of seeds for reforestation.  The seed orchard now suppliesquality jack pine and white spruce seed to several nurseries whereseedlings are grown for our reforestation program.  By using alarge base or trees and selectively introducing new genetic materialinto the tree improvement program, we're ensuring thatthe future generations of trees represent a large and diversegene pool.<P><B><A NAME="sharing">Sharing the Forest Resources</A><BR></B><P>As forest managers, Timberlands foresters have to consider muchmore than harvesting and reforestation operations.  As one ofmany forest resource users, our actions must respect the valuesand needs of others who live, work or play in the forest.<P>Our involvement in several innovative projects helps us learnmore about the needs of other forest users.  It also shows ushow we can integrate their needs into future forest managementpractices.<P><B><A NAME="habitat">Saskatchewan Forest Habitat Project</A><BR></B><P>With input from government, First Nations people, WeyerhaeuserCanada and conservation groups, the Saskatchewan Forest HabitatProject (SFHP) is a long-term undertaking to study the effectsof harvesting and renewal activities on wildlife species and theirhabitat.<P>The research program uses six wildlife indicator species to identifyspecific habitat needs.  For example, some species of birds andanimals prefer mature forest for shelter and nesting.  Othersmake their home in young forests where there's fresh foodand adequate cover.  With this information, our forest plannerscan design new patterns, shapes and sizes of harvest areas thataccommodate the needs of wildlife for shelter, food and habitat.<P><B><A NAME="model">Prince Albert Model Forest</A><BR></B><P>One of ten federally-funded model forests across Canada, the PrinceAlbert Model Forest is a unique project that brings together adiverse group of partners:  Weyerhaeuser Canada, Montreal LakeCree Nation, Prince Albert Tribal Council, the Federation of SaskatchewanIndian Nations, Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management,the Prince Albert National Park, and the provincial section ofthe Canadian Institute of Forestry.<P>Located north of Prince Albert, the Model Forest consists of 314,670hectares of forest, including parts of Weyerhaeuser's FMLAarea, Indian Reserve Land, and the national park.  The five yearproject has two main objectives:<UL><LI>to ensure the sustainable development and use of forestedlands;<LI>to raise everyone's awareness about the concepts ofsustainability, management of the ecosystem and integrated resourcemanagement.</UL><P><P>Why is the Model Forest such an exciting project?  Because thelong-term benefits of the project are just as important as itsshort range goals.  The Prince Albert Model Forest will help itspartners learn how to cooperate and gain a better understandingof each other.  And that will be reflected in the future healthof the forest, the environment and its users.  It will also helpus develop tools and information that will assist us in makingbetter integrated forest management decisions.<P><B><A NAME="clarine">Clarine Lake Demonstration Forest</A><BR></B><P>Like an outdoor classroom, the Clarine Lake Demonstration forestcan help you and your family learn more about what our forestersand our contractors actually do in a working forest.<P>In the heart of Saskatchewan's lake country, 53 kilometresnorth of Prince Albert on Highway #2, you can take a self-guidedtour through the Weyerhaeuser Demonstration Forest.  Signs anda brochure help explain the boreal forest's ecosystem andthe harvesting, renewal and silviculture activities along theDemonstration Forest Trail.<P>Have a close up look at a recently harvested area.  See a newly-plantedforest or other new forests in different stages of growth.  Learnmore about our site preparation activities and how we take careof new forests.  And make sure to bring a picnic lunch  and takein the natural, scenic attractions of the forest.<P><B><A NAME="license">Our True License to Operate</A><BR></B><P>At Weyerhaeuser Canada, we believe public opinion is our truelicense to operate and that belief guides our actions at SaskatchewanTimberlands.<P>Each day we use our human and technical resources to responsiblymanage Saskatchewan's forests.  We're constantlyseeking out resourceful ways to improve our operations for thebenefit of our company, other forest users and our environment.<P>We also depend on you to help us in the development of integratedforest management plans for the future.  We welcome your visits,your input, and your questions about the forest and Weyerhaeuser'sForest Management practices.  Together, we can ensure a positiveand healthy future for Saskatchewan's forest resources.<p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_silvi2.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_silvi2.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_bigriver.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_bigriver.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
