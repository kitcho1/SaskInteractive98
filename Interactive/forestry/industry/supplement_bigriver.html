It was here, in 1911, that the largestsawmill in the entire British Empire was built . . . capable ofproducing one million board feet of lumber each day. Fire destroyedthis grand facility in 1913 but the lumbering tradition has continuedthrough smaller mills operating in the region ever since. Thelatest and most successful of these was established about 10 kilometressouth of the town of Big River in 1976.<BR><P>Weyerhaeuser Canada acquired the Big River lumber operations in1986 and launched a multi-million dollar upgrade program thathas continued to the present day. Incorporating advanced technologies,we are meeting our customer's demands for increased productionand superior quality lumber products. But our resourcefulnessgoes much further. It starts with a commitment to ResponsibleForest Management and continues through every aspect of our operations.<P>A full range of construction quality, kiln-dried dimensional lumberis manufactured at Weyerhaeuser Canada's sawmill near BigRiver, Saskatchewan . . . for markets across Canada and throughoutNorth America.<P><B><A NAME="ifm">Integrated Forest Management</A> </B><P>Big River Lumber depends on a consistent supply of quality sawlogs,but we also recognize the value of our forest resources for awide range of other industrial, recreational, wildlife and environmentalapplications. We fully support the efforts of Saskatchewan Timberlands'foresters to design balanced and integrated management plans thatwork for the benefit of all forest users.<P><B><A NAME="sharing">Sharing Forest Resources</A><BR></B><P>Within Weyerhaeuser Canada's Saskatchewan Division, bothBig River Lumber and Prince Albert Pulp and Paper rely on SaskatchewanTimberlands to manage forest growth and deliver the logs requiredto maintain operations.<P>Preliminary sizing and sorting of logs in the forest -- and coordinatingdeliveries to both processing facilities -- improve operatingefficiencies and reduce transportation costs.<P>The smaller <b>pulpwood</b> logs are trucked directly to PrinceAlbert, while Big River lumber takes the larger spruce, pine andfir (SPF) harvested in the company's Forest ManagementLicense Agreement (FMLA) area.<P>Any waste wood that must be trimmed from sawlogs at Big Riveris chipped and shipped to the pulpmill maximizing the use and value of our forest resources.<P><B>Raw Materials</B>: About 30% of Weyerhaeuser's annualharvest in Saskatchewan is made up of spruce, pine and fir sawlogsdestined for Big River lumber. The balance is pulpwood -- bothsoftwood and hardwood varieties -- trucked to Prince Albert Pulpand Paper.<P><B>Sorting Logs in the forest</B>: Weyerhaeuser minimizes wasteand transportation costs by cutting and sorting logs accordingto their suitability for either lumber or pulp production. Truckerscan often haul sawlogs to Big River and then backhaul pulpwoodto Prince Albert -- or vice versa.<P><B>The Woodyard</B>: Sawlogs are weighed and stockpiled inthe woodyard, ready to feed the sawmill on demand. Approximately400 - 500 thousand cubic metres of sawlogs are required annually.Private purchases from farmers account for roughly 15%, with byfar the largest volume -- 85% of the total sawlog supply -- comingfrom Weyerhaeuser's FMLA area.<P><B><A NAME="art">The Art of Making Lumber</A><BR></B><P>Converting logs to lumber may not be your area of artistic endeavor,but it is for a lot of people in the Big River area of North-CentralSaskatchewan. Here, sawmilling is both art and craft . . . anda tradition that has continued since the turn of the century.Proud to be part of this heritage, Big River Lumber has run upto three shifts a day, or seven days a week, to meet productiondemands. More than just mill workers, these are professional craftspeople -- absolutely committed to produce the best lumber productspossible . . . products that deserve to carry the Weyerhaeuserstamp of approval.<P><B>Market Driven<BR></B><P>It is hard to imagine what our lives would be like without forestproducts. Throughout North America and much of the world, lumberis the most common, the most versatile, the most economical, andthe most environmentally responsible building material availablefor our homes, offices, institutions and commercial structures.It's not a luxury item -- it's a necessity. Andwe do our best to deliver.<P>A full range of kiln-dried western spruce, pine and fir (SPF)dimensional lumber is produced at Big River for markets acrossCanada and throughout North America. Meeting or exceeding CanadianLumber Standards, each finished piece proudly displays the Weyerhaeuseridentification . . . and our assurance of customer satisfaction.<P><B>Sales Network<BR></B><P>Sales of Big River Lumber products are negotiated by WeyerhaeuserCanada's lumber marketing division in Kamloops and at thecompany's regional service centres in Winnipeg, Edmontonand other cities. These offices are constantly updated with computerizedproduction statistics and descriptions of available on-site inventories.<P><B>Top Grades<BR></B><P>Big River Lumber graders get high marks for speed and accuracy.They have to. Just seconds are allowed to examine each board andassign the grade that ultimately determines its price. Regularmonitoring by the Central Forest Products Association, and periodicchecks by Canadian and American Lumber Standards officials keepgraders on their toes. An error of just + or -- 5% in gradingaccuracy could affect the status of grading stamps -- our licenseto value our product.<P>Big River Lumber products are shipped by truck and rail to marketsacross Canada and the United States. Distribution varies fromyear to year depending on current market conditions. Lumber produced at Big River helps to build thousands of familyhomes and commercial buildings each year.<P>As members of the Weyerhaeuser Canada family, everyone who worksat Big River Lumber is committed to achieving the highest qualitystandards in a safe and healthy environment. Toward that goal,we are constantly finding exciting new ways to improve our operationsfor the benefit of our customers as well as our company . . .and for all who share the beauty and bounty of our forest environment.<BR><P>We think it is because of this shared commitment that we havemade so many positive strides in the last few years. Productivityis up. Product quality is steadily improving. And our safety recordis better than ever. Both resourceful and responsible, we arebuilding on our proud heritage and opening new doors for forestproducts made right here in Saskatchewan.<P><B><A NAME="process">The Milling Process</A><BR></B><P><B>1. The Process Begins in the Forest</B><P>Spruce, Pine and Fir sawlogs are harvested and loaded on trucksfor shipment to the sawmill workyard.<P><B>2. Feeding the Log Deck</B><P>With several weeks supply of logs in the woodyard, the sawmillcan operate on a continual basis.<P><B>3. Scan, Slash and Debark</B><P>As tree-length logs enter the system, the cut-off saw operatorevaluates the size and shape of each log and decides the optimumlength to be cut (ranging from 8 to 20 feet). The trimmed logsare moved along conveyor belts and through the debunkers.<P><B>4. Chipping Away at the Edges</B><P>Once cut to length and stripped of bark, the roundwood passesthrough a scanner directing smaller logs to the CHIP-N-SAW andthe larger ones to the CHIP-N-CANTER. In both cases the roundededges that cannot be used, producing a <I>cant</I> (squared log)that will deliver the maximum volume of usable lumber.<P><B>5. Rough Cut</B><P>Chipping heads and saws are automatically positioned to producethe best selection of rough boards from each cant. At this stage,all boards are 2 inches thick but some still have to be trimmedto standard widths and lengths.<P><B>6. Trimmer Optimizer</B><P>Next, the rough boards pass beneath a sophisticated trimmer optimizer.Using laser technology, this scanner produces a three-dimensionaldiagram of each board.<P>Computer analysis then determines the exact edges and trim requirementsto achieve desired recovery and quality standards. Trim saws areautomatically set to make the appropriate cuts.<P><B>7. Edger</B><P>Boards that are not squared on the sides (<I>flitches</I>) aredirected back to an edger for processing into four-sided roughlumber.<P><B>8. An Important By-Product</B><P>Woodchips produced in the milling and planing processes are collectedas raw material for our pulp and paper manufacturing options.<P><B>9. Sort and Stack</B><P>At this stage, the rough green lumber is automatically sortedby size into one of 32 bins. When the bins are full, the lumberis transferred to a rough lumber stacker. Here, they are piledinto bundles with spacers between each tier to allow for evenair circulation in the drying process.<P><B>10. The Dry Cycle</B><P>The stacks are transferred to the green lumber storage area towait their turn in the kilns. At this point, water accounts forapproximately 50% of the weight of each board.<P>The drying cycle lasts up to 33 hours. The temperature insidethe drying kilns is maintained at almost 100 degrees C -- reducingthe moisture content to roughly 15%. Conditions are carefullycontrolled to minimize moisture content (MC) without reducingthe strength or quality of the lumber.<P><B>11. Smooth Shave</B><P>All 2x4 inch and 2x6 inch boards pass through a continuous lumbertester (CLT) which measures strength and elasticity. Those piecesmeeting standards established for high-stress construction applicationsreceive a machine stress rating (MSR) which demands a premiumprice.<P><B>12. A Closer Look</B><P>Every piece of lumber is inspected by experienced graders whoare trained to recognize imperfections and faults. Grading stamps(supplied under license by the Central Forest Products Association)are used to mark each board that meets required quality standards.This is very important because the grade influences both priceand market acceptance.<P><B>13. The Finishing touch</B><P>The finished lumber is sorted by grade, width and length and stackedin bundles approximately 4 feet wide by 3 feet high. These bundlesare then strapped with metal banding and wrapped with a protectiveweather-proof cover. Each bundle is identified by grade, width,length and total number of pieces . . . and then moved to theyard for shipment by truck or train.<p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_timber.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_timber.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./supplement_papp.html">		<A HREF="./supplement_papp.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
