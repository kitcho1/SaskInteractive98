Effective questions serve to focus your observations on only thosethings that might give you an answer. A clearer picture of thefish farm can emerge with the answers to just a few questions. Forexample, what kind of fish are raised there? Are there more ofsome kind than of others or is there only one species of fish (and if only one kind, why this one)? Once some basics are established, observationscan develop progressively and begin to probe more deeply intothe subject.

Then, quantitative measurementscan be made by collecting samples of water and insects for later study or identification in the lab. With proper preparation, the necessary equipment, and some good questions, a field trip can be both an adventure and an education.<BR><P><B>Notes</B><P>1. This field trip may be conducted within the study of ecosytems and alternative forms of farming, but not before you have some basic information about aquaculture operations. Sufficient information is necessary to make the trip meaningful. The best time to view an aquaculture operation is after fish have been stocked and are at the fingerling size (in the case of yearly stocking) or during harvest. Check with the farm you are intending to visit for the appropriate information.<BR><P>2. Review the sample <A HREF="student_fishfieldtrip.html#Field1">Field Trip Report Sheet.</A> It is designed to help you start observing details and asking questions. Make one copy for yourself to take on your field trip. You may wish to produce your own Field Trip Report Sheet.<BR><P>3. Discuss ways to measure the different factors on the Field Trip Report Sheet in preparation for the field trip.<BR><P>4. Prior to going on the field trip, it is important to have the appropriate dress; of collecting material without damaging it or the surroundings; of not polluting the water; of safety; and of making proper notes in the field (pencils are best in case of rain). <BR><P><P><B>Activity - Field Trip to an Aquaculture Operation</B><BR><P>1. Contact one of the aquaculture stations or farms operating in the province. (A complete list can be obtained from Saskatchewan and Environment Resource Management or SERM). Take a trip  to the fish farm and complete theField Trip Report sheet. You may use a subjective measuring system, such as word descriptions. (e.g., water clarity is 'poor' in fish raising area, 'moderate' along water edge). Use all the skills you have acquired to date to describe the fish habitat and fish farm operation. When at the 'farm', walk slowly around the water or pens and observe the overall nature of the operation. Record the positive and any negative aspects of the operation that you notice; and/or environmental factors at work.<BR><P><P>2. Choose an area of the waterbody. Study the area, and using the collecting containers with blank labels on them (masking tape) collect insects or other invertebrates. Record on the container a description of the insect and exactly where it was found.  Insects can be found under vegetation, on shore, or on top of the water. Alternately, use a magnifying glass to observe insects and their natural habitat, sketching individuals and describing their actions. Record the types of plants present, but do not remove any as this may disturb the delicate fish habitat. Create a list of any modifications that were made to the site to incorporate the fish.<BR><P>3. If you have the equipment, measure such factors as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen and dissolved mineral content. Take each of these measurements at two or more different locations. <BR><P>The following are some suggestions for measuring water temperature.<P><B>Water Temperature</B><BR><P>An adequate measure of water temperature can be obtained with a clinical thermometer but extra care has to be taken to get a good reading. Place the bulb of the thermometer about 15 cm below the surface to escape surface temperature influences. Don't forget to shake the thermometer down beforehand and to allow time for it to adjust properly.<BR><P>4. Look for and record signs of larger animals in the area, such as scat, tracks, evidence of animals feeding on bank vegetation. Note any signs of human activity in the area, and try to determine if it has had any impact on the waterbody. What steps (if any) have been taken to control the 'intrusion' of animals close to the water?<BR><P>5. Create tables and graphs to summarize the data recorded for both the biotic and abiotic parts of the ecosystem and fish farm. Interpret this information by proposing relationships between sets of data. For example, how do the abiotic factors affect the vegetation? What relationships are there between plants and the fish? Between sun and plants? Did you discover any foodchains? Predict (and support your predictions through graphing) what would happen if any one of the biotic or abiotic factors were to be removed from the water environment.<BR><P><B>Extensions</B><P>1. Use identification books to name specimens collected on thefield trip. Conduct observations and experiments on some of theliving invertebrates to discover, for example, their preferencesin food, light intensity and pH. Test the water samples. Is there a need for improvements to be made to the water? If so, can you make some suggestions?<BR><P>2. If possible, make a video to accompany your reports. You may want to conduct an interview with the owner of the fish farm. Explore the possibility of contacting schools in other countries (or even in other parts of Canada) and sharing this project. Cooperate and exchange aquaculture information with them.<BR><P><P><B>Evaluation</B><P>1.
