Allocation priorities are assigned to: 1. conservation, 2. Treaty fishing, 3. subsistence fishing, 4. sport fishing, 5. and commercial use by outfitters and commercial fishermen (by the department of Environment and Resource Management).<P></td></tr></table><P><B>Quotas are in three forms:</B><OL>1. <B>Lake Limits</B>: These are set as a total number of kilograms of fish which may be harvested by the commercial fishery on the lake, all species combined. Until 1949, all commercial fishing lakes in the province were managed by lake limits. Today, very few lake limits are used.Advantages to lake limits are that the fishermen can harvest the entire limit and that, if fishing is relatively random, the catch will reflect the abundance of the different species in the lake.A disadvantage to lake limits is that fishermen target one high priced species and avoid or discard others to maximize their incomes. The result is over harvesting and population depletion.</OL><P><OL>2.<B>Tolerance </B>: These are set as a percentage of the total catch which may be made up of gamefish, usually whitefish. Tolerances vary from 0 - 25%.<P>Tolerances are set on a daily basis. If the tolerance is exceeded, the fishery is closed. <P>Tolerance limits began to be applied in about 1950, in response to increased sport fishing activity and tourist outfitting development in the province. Today, about 30 lakes have tolerance limits. Most have been replaced by species limits. </OL><P><OL>3.<B>Species Limits</B>: Species limits refer to separate quotas on each species harvested from a lake.Most lakes are managed with separate species quotas. There is some flexibility in the application of species limits, allowing a higher proportion of the other species.<P>The advantages of species limits include:<BR><UL>- prevention of highgrading</UL><UL>- the ability to allow a commercial fishery in a lake with a high angling pressure by allocating non-gamefish species (like whitefish, tullibee and mullet) to commercial fishery</UL><UL>- the ability to tailor the quotas to each species to the individual lake characteristics</UL> <BR>The disadvantages to species limits are:<UL>- When any one species limit on a lake is taken, the fishery is closed. This often leaves a substantial portion of the allowable yield unharvested.</UL><UL>- Fish populations fluctuate considerable. As mentioned, a random fishery will harvest different species according to their relative abundance.  The quota setting system is not responsive enough to adjust species limits according to changes in population strength.</UL></OL><Table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 height=267 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../media/stills/fisheries/commercial/t_comm40.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/fisheries/commercial/comm40.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>In addition to these quotas, variations can and do occur. For example, in a smaller lake which can support only small harvests, <B>pulse quotas</B> may be set. Twice the usual quotas may be taken if the lake is fished only every second year. Pulse quotas are often lake limits rather than species limits.<P><P>Quota levels are reviewed regularly or on request. Most lakes where reduction occurred are now fully or over allocated to various users. Increasing commercial allocation is almost impossible.<P>Overall, most accessible lakes in Saskatchewan are fully allocated to the users listed.  There is no excess production available to increase commercial fishing quotas. However, not all quotas are fully harvested. Maximizing harvest lies with the fisherman themselves. It is up to the fishermen to regulate harvests, usually through individual quotas on all or limiting species.<p></td></tr></table><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><p><!----- article 3  ------><p><Table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><h3>How many fish am I alone allowed to catch?</h3><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../media/stills/fisheries/commercial/t_comm76.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/fisheries/commercial/comm76.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p><B>Individual Quotas</B> are allocated to each fisherman, usually in the form of separate species limits.Thus each fisherman manages his or her own fishing activity. One or more high priced species can be targeted, within the available species limits and the fisherman can leave other species limits is filled or the fisherman can attempt to balance the catch so as to take most of the available limits.<P>Most fisheries involve more than one fisherman up to seventy.  When species limits are in effect, these fisheries can be closed if one or a few fishermen target a particular limiting species and take the available quota. Other fishermen who are avoiding the limiting species are forced to stop even though they have been harvesting other fish. In some multi-fisherman fisheries, the local fisherman's co-op has divided the quota among its members so that each fisherman has his own share of the limiting species. <P>Lakes with individual quotas include La Ronge, Candle Lake and Pinehouse Lake. In all cases the fisherman have established eligibility criteria, usually to the effect that no new fishermen can be licensed unless an existing fisherman leaves. There is no ownership of the quota by the fishermen, but in most cases if a fisherman quits fishing he can sell his equipment and the co-op will vote the purchaser in as a new fisherman.<P></td></tr></table></TD></TR><!-- ########## LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="./present2.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="./present4.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- ########## / LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
