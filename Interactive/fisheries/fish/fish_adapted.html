Those organisms capable of adapting to the changes survive to continue their species. In other words, those organisms which have the structures necessary to survive in a 'new' environment have the greatest possibility of survival. According to fossil evidence, bony fishes most likely originated in small, freshwater streams. Through a process known as <B>adaptive radiation</B>, fish now occupy the aquatic ecosystems of the world.</td></tr></table><!----- article  ------><p><P>Bony fish are especially adapted to life in the water.

Certainother fish are more specialized in body form, but the torpedo-shapedbody is most typical and suitable for fast, efficient swimming. <P>The 'scientific length of a fish is measured from the tip ofits snout to the end of its trunk at the last vertebrae.  The'fisherman' length includes the caudal (tail) fin.  The rate ofgrowth of a fish depends on the location and feeding habits. For example, fish grow slowly in the cold, northern waters of Saskatchewanin comparison with the same aged fish in central and southernwaters of the province.  The chart illustrates that fish from different lakes in the province, and therefore subjected to different temperatures; grow at different rates.<P></td>	</tr>	</table><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 2  ------><P><h3><A NAME="movement">Locomotion in water</A></h3><P>A fish may propel itself through the water in any one of threeways:<MENU><LI><A HREF="#muscular">Muscular movements</A> of the entire body<LI><A HREF="#fin">Fin and tail movement</A><LI><A HREF="#jet">Jet propulsion</A> from streams of water from the gills </MENU><P><A NAME="muscular"><B>Muscular Movement</B></A><P>Forward motion of a fish is caused primarily by the movement ofits muscular body.  Every fish has interconnected W-shaped musclesegments reaching from the gills to the tail. Between each thereis a silvery tissue which holds one muscle group to another. When a fish is cooked, these tissues dissolve so that the flesh(muscles) fall apart in flakes.  The muscular construction enablesfish to move forward in a wavy manner by driving the resistantwater backwards from the body surface. The body strokes producewaves of moving water.  As these waves pass along the body alternativelyon each side, successive parts of the fish's body are pressedagainst the water. In this manner, sufficient forward forces are createdto drive the fish along, even against currents. The fish's bodymoves from side to side -- the faster the fish swims, the moreviolent the movement becomes.  Anyone who has caught a fish issure to have seen this movement as the fish attempts that getaway. The narrower and slimmer the fish, the greater the size of thelinked muscular contractions.  Some fish can reach speeds of 36to 54 km per hour (20 to 30 miles an hour)!<P><A NAME="fin"><B>Fin and tail </B></A><P>Fin and tail movements play a minor role in swimming comparedto body movements.  A typical bony fish has two sets of pairedfins (pectoral and pelvic) and a set of vertical fins (dorsal,anal and tail). <P>Certain forward movements, maneuvering and steering are the resultof the use of the fins and tail. The pectoral fins are locatedjust behind the gill openings and these, along with the pelvicfins, aid the fish in turning, slowing and stopping.  They actas brakes and rudders.  Both dorsal fins (located along the middleof the fish's back) act as a keel, helping to keep the fish uprightand balanced. The anal fin, located on the underside along themiddle and after the anus, is unpaired and also serves as a keel. Rising and diving are achieved using the fins.  Remaining motionlessrequires fins because the normal backward movement of water throughthe gills during breathing tends to move the fish forward.  Ithas been shown through experimentation that fish are able to swimas efficiently as before, with fins reduced in size or removedaltogether. The only difference is a slight loss in maneuverability.<P><A NAME="jet"><B>Jet Propulsion</B></A><P>A third method of swimming is in use all of the time by a fishswimming forward. Water enters the mouth and exits the <A HREF="fish_intanatomy.html#Respiratory" target="bigwindow">gills</A>. The backward movement of the water moves this fish slightly forward. This method is obviously not the majormethod of moving the fish. <p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 3  ------><p><A NAME="Respiration"><h3>Respiration</h3></A><P>A fish breathes by drawing water into its mouth, then forcingit through its gill chambers and out via the gill slits. Insidethe gill chambers, oxygen from the water is diffused into delicatefilaments (gill filaments) and passes into the blood. Carbondioxide is removed from the blood and discharged into the water.Tiny blood capillaries, embedded in the filaments, make the exchangeof oxygen from the water and carbon dioxide from the fish possible.<p>In deep lakes that freeze over in the winter, fish are not in danger offreezing to death but rather in danger of suffocating. The surface ice prevents oxygen from the atmosphere from dissolving in the lake water. The shallow lakes have muchlower reserves of dissolved oxygen. <P>Hard gill rakers on the inner border of the gill act like a sieve,preventing food materials from passing outward. The four gillopenings on each side of the head are covered by flattened bones,of which the operculum is the largest. The operculum protectsthe delicate gills underneath.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 4  ------><p><A NAME="skin"><h3>Special Covering</h3></A><P>The body of a bony fish is usually covered with scales that canoverlap like the shingles on a roof. The scales themselves aredead material similar in substance to that which composes ourfingernails. These scales can be either <B>cycloid </B>(with smoothrear edges) or <B>ctenoid</B> (with serrated rear edges). It is possibleto determine the age of a fish from observing the number of annualgrowth rings which appear on each scale. Scales lost throughinjury are soon replaced but often they do not grow back in thesame pattern as existing scales. Covering the scales is thinskin filled with many mucous glands which secrete a slimy, slipperyprotective coating. This slime has three important functions:<MENU><OL><LI>The slime waterproofs and insulates the fish, an importantfunction since the animal lives in water and must maintain a balancebetween the outside environment and its internal environment.<p><LI>The slime prevents the entry of skin and other diseaseorganisms.<p><LI>It helps reduce friction from the scales or skin when thefish moves in the water.</OL></MENU><P><P>Proper handling of fish during <A HREF="../sport/licenceinfo.html" target="bidwindow">catch and release </A>angling is important. Care should be exercised when holding the fish; wetting hands helps to reduce the chance of the removal of the protective slimecoating. Without the slime coating, the fish is vulnerable to diseases such as a <A HREF="../habitat/disease_infoskin.html#Saprolegniasis" target="bigwindow">fungus </A>which infects the unprotected area.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 5  ------><p> <A NAME="lateral Line"><h3>Lateral Line</h3></A>  <P>The lateral line running along each side of the body is an opencanal lying just beneath the skin and connects to the surfacethrough pores.  This canal is lined with sensory organs. Thesedetect vibrations and changes in temperature and pressure, andhelp the fish to maintain its balance.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 6  ------><p><A NAME="swim Bladder"><h3>Air Bladder</h3></A><P>The gas-filled air or swim bladder located between the stomachand kidneys helps the fish maintain its buoyancy.  The fish canalter the amount of gas (usually oxygen) in the bladder thus maintaininga chosen depth in the water without constantly swimming.  Whena fish is brought up suddenly from deep water, the pressure ofthe gas in the air bladder can cause the internal organs to bepushed out of its mouth cavity.  In certain fish, the air bladderis connected to the ear by special bones and the bladder servesas a resonant cavity for sounds.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 7  ------><p><A NAME="coloring"><h3>Coloring</h3></A><P>Can't see that fish in the water?  <B>Countershading</B> (obliterativeshading) enables the fish to effectively hide from its prey orpredators that may be above and below.  For example, a northernpike has a greenish dorsal side that, when viewed from above,blends into the lake bottom.  The underside (ventral) is whiteand blends into the sky when viewed from below.  This coloringis frequently enhanced by blotches, spots and bars conflictingpatterns that tend to break up the outline of its body.<P>	</TD>	</TR>	</TABLE>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### --></TD></TR><!-- ########## LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="./types/perch.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->			<A HREF="fish_classify.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- ########## / LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
