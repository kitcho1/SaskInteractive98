These fishseem to have survived from the Cretaceous period that ended aroundsixty-four million years ago -- around the time of the extinctionof the dinosaurs. Saskatchewan has only one species of this incrediblefish. The <B>lake sturgeon</B>, can attain a size of 2.5 metres in lengthand weigh over 140 kilograms. It has been known to live for morethan 150 years. Once numerous in our lakes and rivers, the lakesturgeon is struggling to survive today because of over-fishingand habitat loss.<p>The two most distinguishing featuresof the sturgeon are <UL><LI>its long, almost scaleless bodysupported by a partially cartilaginous skeleton and <LI>the five rows of prominent, bonyplates or <B>scutes</B> which partially cover the thick, toughskin of the back and sides.  </UL><P>Other noticeable features includea <B>heterocercal tail </B>(shark-like tail with large upper lobe) anda shovel-like snout with four barbels which serve as sensory organsfor locating food.  The mouth is toothless and they are primarilybottom feeders feeding on insect larvae, mollusks, worms, smallcrustaceans and a variety of aquatic vegetation.  A single dorsalfin is located far back on the body.  <P>The appearance of the fishchanges as the fish ages.  Young sturgeon have sharp snouts, andthe body is reddish in color with dark grey or black blotcheson the back and sides.  Adult sturgeons are olive brown to greyon the back and sides, and white on the ventral surface of thehead and body.  <p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 2  ------><p><B>Reproduction</B><p>They are a very slow maturing fish.It takes about 25 years for the fish to weigh 14 kilograms anda length of 1 metre. Lake sturgeons reach sexual maturity at theage of 15 to 30 years, males maturing before females.  Late, springtime<A HREF="../fish_intanatomy.html#Reproductive" target="bigwindow">spawning</A> occurs every two or three years for males and every fourto six years for females.  This limits the growth of the sturgeonpopulation and, along with its very slow growth rate, decreasinghabitat and overharvesting contributes to the decline in numbersof the species.  <P>Spawning occurs in the rocky shorelinesof rivers near strong currents where the water is 0.6 to 5 metresdeep and the temperature range is 13 to 18 degrees Celsius. Asingle female arrives at the spawning grounds and is met by severalmales. The spawning of sturgeon is characterized by lots of rollingnear the bottom and leaping out of the water by the males.  Nonest is made and a single female releases hundreds of thousandsof dark-colored eggs. These measure about 3 millimetres in diameterand stick to the rocks and logs on the bottom.  Strong currentsare needed to disperse the eggs and keep them from clumping, whichdecreases the hatch rate.  The current also supplies and removessediment and metabolic waste that could destroy the eggs.  Theeggs hatch in about a week.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 3  ------><p><B>Habitat</B><p>In Saskatchewan, sturgeon can befound in Cumberland Lake, the Churchill River and the SaskatchewanRiver. You would need a <A HREF="../../sport/howtofish.html" target="bigwindow">special licence</A> to angle for this speciesin Saskatchewan.    <p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 4  ------><p><B>Interesting Tidbits About LakeSturgeon</B><p><UL><LI>The fish has been known to 'jump'out of the water; sometimes into the boat of the unsuspectingfisherman!<LI>Once the market value was solow for this species, that it was used as firewood, fertilizerand animal food.<LI>A sturgeon, weighing over 140kilograms (that's 310 pounds) and over seven feet in length, wascaught in one of the Great Lakes of Canada in the 1950's.  Theage of the fish was over 150 years! <LI>A monster sturgeon was takenfrom Roseau River (in Manitoba) at the turn of the century.  Itweighed over 180 kilograms.  That's big!<LI>The age of a sturgeon can bedetermined by counting the number of rings on the pectoral fins;the fish continues to grow as it ages.<LI>The swim bladder contains a gelatinsubstance which was used in making beer and wine as well as jamsand jellies. The hide was used as leather.<LI>The roe was considered a delicacy;caviar for kings. In fact, in England, King Edward II declaredthe sturgeon to be a 'royal fish'. Needless to say,the value of the fish increased dramatically.<LI>The native peoples consideredsturgeon to be 'buffalo of the water'. All parts ofthe sturgeon were used; the flesh from a large sturgeon made severalportions for meals, the tailbones provided arrowheads, cartilaginousskeletons were used to make soup.<p></td></tr></TABLE><p>	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><!-- ########## LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="./burbot.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->				<A HREF="./laketrout.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- ########## / LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
