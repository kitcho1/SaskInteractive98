The Saskatchewan mining industry is of great importance to the people of the province; probably more so than most people realize. Mining has one of the best occupational safety records and offers above average wages and great benefits, affording a pleasant and comfortable lifestyles for mining families.<P>
Over <B>27,000 people</B> are directly and indirectly employed by the mining industry. This represents over 6% of the work force in Saskatchewan. Direct employment represents over $250 million dollars in wages, salaries and employee benefits. The mining industry has far reaching economic impact greatly benefits the people of the province. A total of almost $2.0 billion has been expended by mining companies directly in Saskatchewan in each of the last few years.</TD>
<P>Many of the mining jobs are in the less populated areas of the province, 
thereby bringing employment and a stable economic base to regions which would 
otherwise have little to sustain them. The development of Saskatchewan mines means jobs. 
For example, consider the development of a uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan. 
Along with the jobs that are created during the exploration phase, there are jobs to be 
occupied during the mining and milling phases. These jobs are directly related to the industry. 
The indirect creation of jobs include the building of roadways to reach the mine, 
the construction of new homes for miners and their families, the businesses required to 
service the families (including construction of community facilities like rinks, 
gymnasiums and golf courses), school grants and the list goes on.  
Check out the <A HREF="careers.html" target="bigwindow">employment opportunities</A> 
section to discover the multitude of jobs tied in with the mining industry.<P>

The total capital investment by the mining industry to date is in excess of <B>4 billion dollars</B>. 
Much of this amount has been invested in the form of construction, machinery and equipment. 
Other expenditures include the transportation of mineral products within 
Saskatchewan and goods and services. Mining accounts for 11% of the gross domestic product in 
the province. That means $2000 for every person in Saskatchewan is a result of mining activity. 
Saskatchewan receives a substantial amount in

<P>Miners help Saskatchewan in that the companies donate monies to the operation of community organizations, operation of facilities and other worthy causes. Mining employees have freely volunteered their time to operate company equipment on projects undertaken by the community for mutual benefit of all. They bring a variety of skills to their towns which contribute to all aspects of community life. They serve on municipal councils, school boards and recreation boards. Many are leaders in fundraising, sports, educational, charitable and business activities. They conduct mine tours for teachers and the public and give demonstrations to students of the operation of equipment donated to technical and secondary schools.<P>
Even more important is the impact on the quality of life in small communities. Miners and their families become involved in the towns in which they live and work. They are active, energetic citizens who are concerned with the quality of life in their community. <P> Miners' dollars are spent in local grocery, clothing, and hardware and furniture stores. Their families fill the schools and churches, and their involvement makes their communities better and more prosperous places for Canadians to live.

<P> Have you ever thought about all the related jobs that are sustained by the mining industry? Consider these...equipment builders, suppliers and service people; the construction industry; welders, plumbers, electricians; the transportation industry; ports, waterways, shipping, railroads and trucking; and manufacturers at all levels. Consider the transportation industry on its own. Many airports in the Canadian  northland were built to aid in the exploration of minerals. Today, they handle a varied flow of cargo and an increasing number of passengers. Bush planes, such as the Otter and Beaver, which were first designed for use on the Canadian north are now sold around the world.<P>
