In fact, uranium mining employs more then 2500 people in Saskatchewan, either directly or through contractors. More then 2000 of these workers are employed at the mine sites and in exploration activities. In all, well over 35000 jobs are related to the mining industry.<P>Of the people employed in the Saskatchewan mining industry, many work at the mine sites; for example, an engineer at a potash mine, a heavy equipment operator at a coal mine. As well, the mining sector produces and supports many jobs in related industries throughout Canada. Equipment builders, suppliers and service people; the construction industry; welders, plumbers and electricians; the transportation industry; ports, waterways, shipping, railroads and trucking; and the manufacturers at all levels benefit from mining dollars. <P>Work itself is one of the most important aspects of a person's life. You may work right now, or you may be in the process of acquiring the education or training necessary for a job. Most people in our society spend about two-thirds of their life working and of these years, about one-third of your waking hours are spent on the job. As well, people pass a great deal of time getting ready to go to work, travelling to a from the work place, recovering from work and thinking about work (day and night). Most people would rather work than not work. The work place can offer certain satisfaction and rewards to enhance a person's life. Work offers a chance to show pride, to improve yourself through skills and help reinforce a positive attitude about yourself. <P>Most people choose a career path because they enjoy the work involved and have talents to contribute to the occupation they have chosen. Some people try several jobs until they find one that meets their needs and is satisfying. <P><B>Activity #1: Interview</B><P>So, how does one find that perfect job in a world filled with unlimited opportunities? First of all, one must find out what is involved in any job and the necessary skills needed to accomplish that job.  One method is the interview. The key to a good interview is to ask the right kinds of questions.  As you conduct interviews, you will learn how to ask the right questions. You will learn how  to ask questions based on the questions you have received. Through the dialogue, you will gradually build up a picture of the person being interviewed. Interviewing is an art, and the questioning techniques are most important. Try to interview the person in his/her own home or place of work. You will find that you can infer details from those surroundings. Try to tape-record the interview and transcribe a portion of this.<P><P>1. You will interview one person in the mining industry that works at a mine site and one person that is employed with a mining company away from the mine site. Select and contact the people to be interviewed. Write a brief description of each person. Include in that description:	<UL><LI>name and job title<LI>years of experience on the job<LI>years of related experience (if applicable)<LI>qualifications required for the job<LI>reasons for selecting him/her for the interview<LI><A HREF="../economy/careers.html" target="bigwindow">ideas for interviewees</A></UL><P><P>2. In preparation for the interview, create a list of questions (5 to 10) that you will ask to gain information about the person's occupation. One of these question should relate to job satisfaction. <P>3. Create a list of questions (5 to 10) that you will ask regarding environmental issues or concerns that may be associated with their area of employment in the mining industry.<P>4. Conduct the interviews and record all necessary information (or tape record and transcribe the interview).<P>5. Write a summary, which contains your thoughts and opinions about the two jobs. Include in your summary your desire (if any) to pursue a career in these areas.<P><B>Evaluation</B><P>1. Submit the interview questions (pre-interview) for editing if necessary.<P>2. Submit the interview transcript and summary. Prepare additional questions for future use in the interview process.</table></td)<P></TD></TABLE><TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION --><A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->			<A HREF="info.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="econ_career2.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- ########## / LINZ BOTTOMNAV ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
