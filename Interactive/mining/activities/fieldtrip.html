Mines have been brought into operation to extract the valuable minerals. But, the process does not stop here. After the raw minerals are removed from the ground, they are processed and treated in a variety of ways, depending on the nature of the mineral and upon its use. This processing may take place at the mine, at a plant located some distance away, or at both places. The minerals mined in Saskatchewan are used not only in Canada, but also in other countries around the world. <P>Much of the lignite coal mined in around Estevan is used in the generation of electrical energy in this province. Some of the briquets we use in our barbecues are produced from Saskatchewan coal. Uranium and its by-products are used for nuclear reactors to produce electrical energy; as a fuel for ships, submarines, satellites; in color television, and in the treatment of cancer. Gold is used in jewelry and the decorative arts. It is also used for electrical contracts, laboratory equipment, and on aircraft and earth satellites. Gold is used in the fields of optics, atomic energy, heat control and measurement, medical therapy, chemical manufacturing and brazing. Potash is necessary to life, being used as a fertilizer to increase the potassium content of soil. Without potassium, plants would not grow and, without plants, we would not exist. Most of the potash produced is used as fertilizer, but there are other uses for the mineral. Potash is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, synthetic rubber, television tubes, vat dyes, fine glass and chinaware.  Minerals make possible our shelter (clay for bricks), our places of work and education, transportation and communication, and even our clothes. <P>One of the best ways to understand how these minerals are taken from the ground is to visit the site of extraction; the mine.<P>On any field trip, the first observation skill is learning to ask good  questions. Effective questions serve to focus your observations on only thosethings that might give you an answer. A clearer picture of the mine operation can emerge with the answers to just a few questions. For example, what kind equipment is needed to extract the mineral? Is more than one mineral mined at the site? Where is the mineral processed? How is this done? Once some basics are established, observations can develop progressively and begin to probe more deeply into the subject. With proper preparation, the necessary equipment, and some good questions, a field trip can be both an adventure and an education.<P><P><B>Notes</B><P>1. This field trip may be conducted within the study of Saskatchewan resources but not before you have some basic information about mining operations. Sufficient information is necessary to make the trip meaningful. Check with the mine you are intending to visit for the appropriate information (best time to visit; visitor center only or actual mine site tour; samples)<P><P>2. Review the sample <A HREF="#Field">Field Trip Report Sheet.</A> It is designed to help you start observing details and asking questions. Make one copy for yourself to take on your field trip. You may wish to produce your own Field Trip Report Sheet.<P><P>3. Discuss ways to measure the different factors on the FieldTrip Report Sheet in preparation for the field trip.<P><P>4. Prior to going on the field trip, it is important to have the appropriate dress; of safety; and of making proper notes in the field.<P><P><B>Activity - Field Trip to an Mining Operation</B><P>1. Contact one of the mines operating in the province. (A complete list can be obtained from Saskatchewan Energy and Mines (SEM). Take a trip  to the mine and complete the Field Trip Report sheet. You may use a subjective measuringsystem, such as word descriptions. Use all the skills you have acquired to date to describe the mine operation or processing facilities. When at the mine, walk slowly  and observe the overall nature of the operation. Record the positive and any negative aspects of the operation that you notice; and/or environmental factors at work.<P><P>2. Choose an area of the mine site (extracting mineral, processing area). Study the area, and if possible, use the collecting containers with blank labels on them (masking tape) to collect mineral samples.  Record the area around the mine site, looking for reclamation of site, safety standards adhered to and any other interesting information about the mine.<P><P>3. Look for and record the number of workers at the mine site. Include a description of the types of workers and numbers (example: heavy equipment operators - 10; engineer - 2) <P><P>4. What types of environmental safeguards are there? (scrubbers on stacks, replacement of overburden, waste disposal)<P><P>5. Create tables and graphs to summarize the data recorded.<P><B>Extensions</B><P><P>1. Take a close look at any mineral samples collected on thefield trip. Conduct observations and experiments such as tests geologists use to identify samples (color, hardness, scratch, taste, smell, pH). <P>2. If possible, make a video to accompany your reports. You may want to conduct an interview with the mine operator. Explore the possibility of contacting schools in other countries (or even in other parts of Canada) and sharing this project. Cooperate and exchange mining information with them.<P><P><B>Evaluation</B><P>1. Using a flow chart or chain-link diagram, indicate the major considerations necessary for a successful mining operation. <BR><P>2. Write reports that summarize and interpret thedata collected.<P></td></table>		<TABLE BORDER=.5>	<CENTER><CAPTION><B><A NAME="Field">Field Trip Report Sheet</A></B></CAPTION>	</CENTER>		<TR><TD><B>Name:</B><P><B>Class:</B><P><B>Date:<BR></TD>	</TR>	<TR><TD HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=235><B>Describe the mining operation.
