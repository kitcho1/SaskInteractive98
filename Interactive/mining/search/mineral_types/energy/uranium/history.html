	<ul>
<li><b>1942</b> - Nuclear research was conducted in Canada by British scientists.<br>The first controlled nuclear chain reactor was produced in the United States by a team led by Enrico Fermi. No public announcement was made because of wartime restrictions.
<li><b>1943</b> - In order to gain control of all sources of uranium in their respective countries, the governments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States banned all private exploration for, and development of, radioactive materials. <br>The federal government established a Crown corporation, Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, to oversee Canadian uranium interests. This company expropriated the uranium mine at Port Radium (Northwest Territories) and was given a monopoly in all uranium prospecting and developing activities.  
<li><b>1944</b> - Chalk River, Ontario, was established as the first national research centre in Canada.
<li><b>1945</b> - A second discovery if uranium ore was made at Goldfields, Saskatchewan. <br>Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited staked its first claim in the Lake Athabasca area in northern Saskatchewan.<br>The first operational nuclear reactor outside the United Sates was started up at Chalk River.<br>The Manhattan Project, research into the development of the atomic bomb being done in the United States, produced the first atomic explosion in New Mexico. <br>Atomic bombs were dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on August 6th and Nagasaki on August 9th, demonstrating the power contained in the uranium atom. This ended World War II and started the nuclear arms race.

<li><b>1952</b> - The town of Uranium City was established in the area of Beaverlodge. Buildings form Goldfields were moved to the site. <br>An operator's error caused radioactive particles to spread throughout the nuclear reactor at Chalk River. Massive clean-up was required.
<li><b>1953</b> - The mine and mill at Beaverlodge went into production.
<li><b>1954</b> - The hydrogen bomb was developed in the United States, quickly followed by similar developments in the U.S.S.R.
<li><b>1955</b> - Gunnar Mines Limited, a private uranium mining company, began production in the area of Beaverlodge.
<li><b>1956</b> - The first nuclear energy power plant opened in England.
<li><b>1957</b> - Lorado Uranium Mines Limited, a private company, began production in the area of Beaverlodge. <br>Numerous small mines operated in the Beaverlodge area, using Eldorado and Lorado milling facilities. <br>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was created to establish and administer international safeguards for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
<li><b>1958</b> - Contracts with the United States to purchase Canadian uranium were not renewed.
<li><b>1959</b> - A second nuclear development centre was established at Whiteshell in Manitoba.
