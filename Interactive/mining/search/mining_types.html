Most potash mining in Saskatchewan is mined by this conventional method.   The ore is extracted from the ground by sinking a shaft and then removing the material by digging.  The shafts are about 5 m in diameter and vary from 900&nbsp;m to 1100&nbsp;m deep. <p><img align=left width=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 src="../../media/stills/mining_energy/potash/pcs_allan/t_storage01.jpg"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"        onclick="window.open('../../media/stills/mining_energy/potash/pcs_allan/storage01.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>In Saskatchewan, potash is found over 1000&nbsp;m underground. Before sinking can begin, a timber or steel structure , known as a <b>headframe</b>, is built above the ground to carry the cable sheave wheels and provide for efficient dumping of rock and ore.  Allan Potash Mine can be seen from miles away by the two huge headframes. One of these structures is just over 65&nbsp;m high that stands on four enormous straddle legs over the production shaft. Its design eliminates foundation problems by placing the weight of the structure well away from the shaft opening.

When attempts were made to penetrate the Blairmore, the water and sand broke through, flooding the shaft. The problem was solved by freezing the formation and digging through it to the desired depth. Techniques for holding back the water in the shaft after the ice melted involved two systems: 	<ol><li><b>grouting</b> - pumping cement into the formation to seal the cracks (fissures)<li><b>tubbing</b> - a concrete lining was poured against the frozen ground and reinforced with steel.	</ol> 	</td></tr><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><img align=left width=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 src="../../media/stills/mining_energy/potash/t_potash15.jpg"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"        onclick="window.open('../../media/stills/mining_energy/potash/potash15.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p><p>The shaft is constructed to allow equipment and men to enter the underground.

Most of the rocks in the Athabasca Basin, where the majority of uranium is located, are sandstone. They are very porous and are saturated with groundwater. If the water table is higher than the ore body, the pumping out of water is necessary in order to lower the water table. This pumping continues throughout the mining operation in order to maintain dry conditions. The next step is the removal of the material (soil, sand and rock) located on top of the ore body. This overburden is removed by using gigantic mechanical shovels and large trucks. The same equipment is used to remove uranium ore from the ground and take it to large storage piles where it waits to be used in the milling process.<p> </td></tr></table><br><p><tr><td><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION --><a href="#pagetop" onmouseover="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return true;" onmouseout="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;" target="bigwindow"><img name="topBtn" src="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" height=20 width=110 vspace="4" border=0 alt="Return to top of page" target="bigwindow"></a></td><td></td><td>    <!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->                <a href="rights.html" target="bigwindow"> 				<a href="rights.html" onmouseover="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return true;" 				onmouseout="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><img align=left name="prevBtn" src="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border=0 alt="Return to previous page" target="bigwindow"></a>        <!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->                <a href="prospect.html" target="bigwindow">                <a href="prospect.html" onmouseover="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return true;"                 onmouseout="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;" ><img align=right name="nextBtn" src="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border=0 alt="Go to next page" target="bigwindow"></a></td></tr><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></table></body></html>
