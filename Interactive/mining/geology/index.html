The theory of  <b>plate tectonics</b> has helped to explain the formation of orebodies.  This theory states that the earth's crust is made up of  large plates.  The plates meet and move over each other.

Scientists have been able to calculate the age of the planet by using a combination of techniques including the dating of meteorites made of the same material as that found in our earth. Scientists estimate the age to be around 4.5 billion years old. Knowing this, one can only imagine the length of time required to form the mountain ranges found on the earth today. Some ranges have been exposed to the forces of nature for a longer period of time and the effects of erosion are apparent. Some mountain ranges are relatively young. The forces involved in forming mountains are also responsible for the appearance of minerals in the ranges. <p>Our earth is made up of various elements. The elements that are found on their own in nature are called <b>native elements</b>. These include the ones in greatest abundance (oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron and calcium) and those found as pure metals (<a href="../search/mineral_types/base/gold.html" target="bigwindow">gold</a>, silver and <a href="../search/mineral_types/base/copper.html" target="bigwindow">copper</a>). Other elements have combined chemically with other elements forming compounds known as minerals. These solid minerals make up the structures called rocks. Various types of rocks exist on the earth and are classified by geologists according to the substances contained within and by the way the rock was formed. For example, igneous rocks are the result of volcanic activity, where molten rock from deep within the earth is released to the surface, where it is cooled. Gold is one mineral found in this type of orebody.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br> </td></tr></table>  <!----- article 3  ------> <table width=420 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top>      <h3>What makes a mineral valuable to mining industry?</h3><br><img align=left width=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 src="../../media/stills/mining_energy/uranium/t_cluff02.jpg"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"        onclick="window.open('../../media/stills/mining_energy/uranium/cluff02.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Minerals become of economic interest when they are found in concentration; of sufficient quantity and quality to make recovery economically feasible.

As the magma cools, crystals form within the rock, in concentrated form. Each mineral that forms, does so in sequence, according to the freezing temperature (point at which liquid solidifies) unique to that mineral. As the crystals form within the magma, they also react with the material, creating even more types of minerals. Some magmas released to the earth's surface contain valuable elements such as nickel, cooper, gold, silver and platinum and some magmas are released to the ocean floor are sources of base metals.  <p>Igneous rocks are the most abundant of rocks and are very common in the <a href="scale.html#Precambrian" target="bigwindow">Precambrian (Canadian) Shield</a>, which covers northern Saskatchewan and most of Canada. Classification of igneous rocks is based on the observable characteristics such as the rock's mineral content and texture as well as size, shape and arrangement of the crystals.
