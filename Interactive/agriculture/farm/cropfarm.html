Other economically significant crops are rye, flaxseed, mustard seed, lentils and canary seed.Of nearly 35 million acres of farm land planted to wheat in Canada, over 21 million acres of that is seeded in Saskatchewan, mainly with spring wheat and durum.<p>Recently, economic recession and unstable grain markets have resulted in diversification of grain crops produced in Saskatchewan, but wheat remains an essential commodity. Three million acres of barley and three million acres of canola are planted in the province each year.

Grains are graded on the basis of colour, plumpness of kernels and protein content, with each grade handled separately. Thirty thousand rail cars are required to move the 30 million tonnes of grain to ocean ports in Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Churchill, and to Thunder Bay at the head of the St. Lawrence Seaway. At the ports, the grain is transferred to the terminal elevators, weed seeds removed if not already done, and the grain loaded on to ships.<p><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_winterfield.jpg" ALT="Winter Field" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="149" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_winterfield.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Winter winds blow snow from fields where tillage has buried the straw, whereas fields with standing stubble (straw that remains after the grain is harvested) retain ten to twenty centimetres of snow.  The water from the snow can be an important addition to the moisture available for the next year's crop resulting in better yields.  In addition, soil erosion by winds from bare fields in winter leads to gradually decreasing soils productivity, and must be avoided.  Some call the mixture of snow and soil or dirt that blows into ditches near bare fields <code>&quot;</code>snirt<code>&quot;</code>, a fitting term for something that we would rather not see.<p><br><!------SPRING ------><IMG SRC="../nav/dv_spring.jpg" ALT="Spring" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="20" hspace="10" BORDER="0"><br><P><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_wintercreek.jpg" ALT="Spring Breakup" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_wintercreek.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>"Spring on the prairies comes like a surprise, one minute there's snow on the ground, the next there's sun in your eyes."<br><BLOCKQUOTE>Connie Kaldor, 1975</BLOCKQUOTE>Spring snow-melt is important on the prairies.  Some of the water soaks into the soil and is stored for the summer's crops.  Runoff water fills the potholes and ponds, providing nesting areas for ducks and other birds, or is retained in reservoirs for use by people and livestock in the dry months which are almost certain to follow.  Some of the water moves through the soil to recharge the groundwater, which is important where water from wells is used by farms, towns or cities.<p><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_soilsamp.jpg" ALT="Soil Sampling" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_soilsamp.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Sampling the soil in each field is the first step in obtaining an analysis or soil test that measures nutrients in the soil, and recommends amounts of fertilizer for the next crop. This is best done in the spring prior to seeding, since some nutrients such as nitrogen are mobile and can leach from the soil.Truck-mounted samplers are convenient because several samples are needed from each field to give a good representative measurement.<p><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_fueltruck.jpg" ALT="Fuel Truck" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="158" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_fueltruck.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Fuel to power tractors is but one of the costs incurred by farmers to produce grain.

Not enough moisture, high winds, hail and pests can all take their toll. The farmer must be especially careful about controlling the weeds and pests in his crop as they will affect the yield and likely affect his income for the year. Many farmers edge their bets against severe losses, by taking out crop insurance.<p>Herbicides are chemical compounds that are used to control weeds in crops. Most herbicides are produced industrially. It takes years of development and research to test herbicide effectiveness and safety. Appropriate use and safe handling of herbicides are important, as well as improved sprayers which apply them with minimal drift to adjacent fields. Herbicide residues are a concern as a future sensitive crop grown in the same field may be affected. Pesticide residues can also find their way into the ground water.<p><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_elevcanola.jpg" ALT="Canola Field" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_elevcanola.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>The yellow flowers of canola are a familiar mid-summer scene in the parkland region of Saskatchewan.

Most Saskatchewan farmers, however, cut their crops a few days prior to threshing. A swather cuts the grain and places it in long rows. The swathed grain is picked up and threshed by a combine, once it has dried and the kernels hardened. A wet fall or early winter can cause some of the grain in the swaths to sprout or mould thereby reducing quality.<p><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_harvest.jpg" ALT="Combining" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_harvest.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Thinking about the coming fall and winter, the farmer can catch much of the precious snow moisture and avoid soil erosion by careful combining techniques.The amount of snow retained in stubble fields can be increased by leaving strips of taller stubble.

An inexpensive attachment is available for swathers that leaves the strips.<br><P><!------ FALL ------><IMG SRC="../nav/dv_fall.jpg" ALT="Fall" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="20"  hspace="10" BORDER="0"><br><P><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_cr_truckdump.jpg" ALT="Storing Grain" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="4"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/cr_truckdump.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Farmers produce more grain that can be delivered to the grain elevators at harvest-time, so storage must be provided on farms.
