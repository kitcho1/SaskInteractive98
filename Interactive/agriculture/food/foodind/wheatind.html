At the time of its introduction, the elevator offered a big advantage in handling grain in bulk. Previously, grain had to be bagged at the farm and loaded and unloaded several times before reaching its final destination. <p>The elevator is the farmers' link to both domestic and overseas markets. Early elevators stored 650 to 800 tonnes of grain and were built 11 to 16 km apart. This distance was considered reasonable for horse drawn wagons to deliver the grain from the farm. Modern elevators are much further apart but can store up to 10,200 tonnes and accommodate semi-trailer trucks with a loaded weight of 80 tonnes. Newer elevators are highly automated moving 340 tonnes of grain per hour.<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/industry/cwb/t_cwb_sign.jpg" ALT="Wheat Board Sign" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/industry/cwb/cwb_sign.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><A NAME="market"><B>Grain Marketing</B></A><p><B><I>The Canadian Wheat Board</I> </B>is the sole marketing agent for wheat grown in Canada for human consumption or destined for export.

An elevator agent, who acts on behalf of the Wheat Board, grades the grain according to Canadian Grain Commission standards for quality, appearance, plumpness and density.  Once the grain is graded, the agent mechanically transfers it to a bin in the elevator holding the same grade of grain. Based on the grade, the farmer is then paid an <I>initial price</I>, which is a portion of the total price expected when the grain is finally sold on the world markets. Throughout the year, the money made by the Wheat Board in selling grain is pooled. At the end of the year, all operating expenses are tallied up and deducted and a <I>final payment</I> per bushel calculated for each grade sold. The farmer then receives a final cheque based on the grade and quantity originally delivered.<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/industry/cwb/t_cwb09.jpg" ALT="Wheat Export Sign" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="151" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/industry/cwb/cwb09.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Selling wheat to foreign countries can be complicated by political interference and war, as well as by competition from other exporters of wheat, like the United States and the European Economic Community. The Wheat Board may sell wheat directly to a customer, or it may sell through accredited exporters, making use of the expertise of private traders with offices and contacts throughout the world.  Sales and market development are the major focus of the Wheat Board.

There are three major grain ports: <B>Thunder Bay</B>,in Ontario on Lake Superior ; <B>Prince Rupert</B> in Northern B.C. and <B>Vancouver</B>,lower mainland B.C.

In more than half the countries in the world, bread accounts for more than 50 percent of the total food energy. Baking is one of the largest food industries. In the graphic, loaves of bread are shaped in a commercial bakery.  Commercial bread-baking systems involve dough mixing, fermentation with yeast, dividing and panning the dough, followed by baking, slicing and wrapping of the loaves. <p>The bread making process improves the nutritional value of the original flour.  The fermentation of the yeast and subsequent baking  cause a number of chemical reactions to occur. The major protein <I>gluten</I> coagulates and the starch partially gels. The brown crust on bread is produced by a special chemical reaction called the Maillard Reaction.<p>Speciality breads such as "sour dough" are made by adding milk and lactic acid bacteria as well as yeast. The bacteria ferment the milk to lactic acid giving the bread a tangy taste. The volume of bread is determined by the dough's stretching qualities produced by the protein gluten which is present in high amounts in Hard Red Spring Wheat - the premium bread making wheat.<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_bread.jpg" alt="Bread" align=left width="200" height="269" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/bread.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>A commercial baker stacks finished loaves.
