Historically, canola was developed from rapeseed. Rapeseed was grown for its oil, which was used for lubricants and not for human consumption.  Rapeseed had limited value as a commercial crop.<p>In the 1940s, Canadian farmers planted only 6000 acres of rapeseed per year.  In the 1990s, farmers are planting about 10.5 million acres of canola annually.  Nearly 5.5 million of that is grown in Saskatchewan.<p>Canola is Saskatchewan's second most important crop, after wheat.<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_canola.jpg" alt="Canola Field" align=left width="200" height="134" hspace="10" vspace="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/canola.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Bright yellow fields of blossoming canola are a familiar sight in summer.<p>Canola was developed from rapeseed through plant breeding and research.  Canola oil has a complement of fatty acids that make it one of the healthiest edible oils.  In contrast, rapeseed oil was not suitable for human consumption.  Canola meal is a nutritious livestock feed, whereas rapeseed meal contained glucosinolates that inhibited livestock growth.<p>The knowledge and ingenuity of science has transformed rapeseed into canola. Such miracles have come about only after years of hard work, research, and countless field tests of new canola varieties.<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><a name="history"><strong>The History of Canola</strong></a><p>Farmers of the 1940s discovered that rapeseed grew well on the Prairies, and was well-suited to the climate of the parkland region.<p><table border="0" cellpadding="0">	<td><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_wjwhite.jpg" alt="W.

Fatty acids are the building blocks of oils and fats.  Canola is considered to be a "healthy oil", having oils with relatively low amounts of saturated fatty acids  which  have been linked to high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease. Canola oil also has high amounts of the healthy fatty acid oleic acid.<p><table border="0" cellpadding="0">	<td><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_wetter.jpg" alt="Les Wetter" align=left width="200" height="93" hspace="10" vspace="5"></td>	<td><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/wetter.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>Dr. Les Wetter and Dr. Henry Sallans, Dr. Burt Craig and Dr. Claire Youngs were all key players in the canola story.</td></table><p><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_downey.jpg" alt="Keith Downey" align=left width="200" height="92" hspace="10" vspace="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/downey.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Dr. Keith Downey, a scientist at the Agriculture Canada Research Station in Saskatoon, directed research that resulted in new and better varieties of canola.

The canola grower "sells direct" to the canola buyer. Price is set by supply and demand.About 40 percent of the canola traded each year, is used domestically, with the remainder being exported. Canola is therefore not subject to the "wheat price wars" that have occurred as countries try to bolster their share of world exports by subsidising production. Canadian farmers have always suffered in such cases.For those commodities marketed by the Canadian Wheat Board, farmers receive a pooled price. This means that the payment is based of the average price the Wheat Board receives for all the sales of a particular grain which it sells during the course of a year. <p>Within the open market system, producers receive the price of canola on the day the crop is sold. Producers must be aware of the many factors that cause the crop prices to fluctuate and time their deliveries and sales appropriately.Here we see the farmer delivering seed to the country elevator who acts as an agent for another buyer such as a crushing plant. The producer may also wish to sell his seed directly to the crushing plant. There are nine oilseed crushing plants which crush canola, seven in western Canada and two in eastern Canada. Six of the plants crush canola exclusively. Other sales can be made directly to export companies or grain agents. Since canola is a commodity it is traded on the <I>Futures Market</I>. Some producers  decide to use the futures market to "lock-in" a price and then actually deliver against a <I>futures contract</I> to one of the acceptable delivery points<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_shipping.jpg" alt="Japan Dock" align=left border="0" width="200" height="96" hspace="10" vspace="5"><form><input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/shipping.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Unloading canola at a Japanese port, Japan is Canada's number one export market for canola and canola oil. Almost 1,700,000 million tonnes of canola seed are shipped to Japan every year.

After initial crushing, a crude oil remains.  When that is cleaned and refined, the oil can be stored safely for months or years.  Canola seed yields about 40% oil and 60% meal.<p>Margarine is packaged for sale in convenient sizes.  Canola oil is low in cholesterol and an excellent choice for increasingly health-conscious consumers.<p>Canola seed is transported to crushing plants in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Saskatchewan, where it is processed.  Canola oil is shipped, in bulk, from there to domestic and foreign markets, or packaged at the plant for distribution to consumers.<p>A typical processing plant has a daily crushing capacity of 6.5 thousand tonnes.  The crushing plant at Nipawin, Saskatchewan, has an annual capacity of 104,000 tonnes.<p>Japan is Canada's main export market for canola seed.  Other importers of smaller quantities are the United States, Western Europe, Belgium and Korea.<p>Canada is a net exporter of vegetable oils, with the U.S.A. importing more than 80% of our production.  About two-thirds of the canola meal produced goes to the U.S.A.  Japan and Norway are also major importers of meal.<p>Canola is fifth in the world trade in agricultural crops, after rice, wheat, maize and cotton.  Canola is Canada's third most important grain export, after wheat and barley.<!-- ########## COLUMN  END ########## --></td></tr></table><!-- ########## CONTENT TABLE END ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOM NAV BUTTONS # # # # # # # # # # --><tr><td><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<a href="#pagetop" 		onmouseout="hi_off('TopImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('TopImg')">	<img name="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" height=20 	width=110 vspace="4" border="0" alt="return to top of page"></a></td><td></td><td><!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<a href = "./foodindwht.html" 		onmouseout="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<img align=left name="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border="0" 		alt="return to previous page"></a><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<a href = "./meatind.html" 		onmouseout="hi_off('NextImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('NextImg')">	<img align=right name="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border="0" 		alt="go to next page"></a>	<!-- # # # # # # # # # #BOTTOM NAV END # # # # # # # # # # --></td></tr></td></tr></table><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></body></html>
