Dairy cows now produce twice as much milk per year as their predecessors did fifty years ago.<p>Agricultural science has been a significant factor in this development, through an increased understanding of genetics, advances in veterinary medicine, and the analysis of how nutrients in cattle feed contribute to milk quality and production.<p>There are over 45,000 dairy cows on Saskatchewan farms.
