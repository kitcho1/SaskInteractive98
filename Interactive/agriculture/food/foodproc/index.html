The shelf-life of canned foods is virtually indefinite. <p>The canning process uses heat to destroy harmful microorganisms.  The entire can of food must be subject to very high temperature.  Canned beans are heated at 121 degrees C for twelve minutes.  Other foods such as pork and beans must be heated for over 100 minutes at 118 degrees C.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><B>Heat</B><p>Heat is probably the most widespread method of preserving food. Cooking is usually the last thing done before food is consumed. During this process many of the harmful bacteria such as <I>E.coli</I> are destroyed. One of the most deadly toxins that causes <I>botulism</I>, produced by the bacteria <I>Clostridium botulinum</I>, can only be destroyed by exposing food to moist heat at over 100 degrees celsius for ten minutes. Be careful how you cook your hamburgers! <p>Various degrees of heat treatment are sterilization, Pasteurization and blanching and Ultra-high-temperature (UHT)<p>UHT apple juice is packaged under aseptic, or sterile, conditions.  UHT processing is an alternative to canning.  Instead of heating juice in the tin, it is heated to very high temperatures before it is packaged, then delivered directly into sterilized packages.  <p>UHT processing and aseptic packaging are two innovations which were developed concurrently.  UHT food is heated to 140-144 degrees C for a few seconds by mixing the food with steam, which is very soon after removed from the food, resulting in almost instantaneous cooling.  Aseptic packaging involves the use of special plastic film, sometimes combined with aluminum foil, which is produced under sterile conditions.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 3  ------><B>Drying</B><p><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_oven.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/oven.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>A dielectric oven is used to dry crackers in a modern food processing plant.  The essential principle underlying the drying of foods is dehydration, or the removal of water from food.  Hot air used in various types of air driers is a common method of food preservation.  The heat required by air driers is large, but hot air permits gradual drying and sufficient control over the process to prevent scorching or discolouration. <p> Every possible precaution is taken to ensure that dried foods such as crackers enjoy an optimum shelf-life.  High quality raw materials are carefully stored, then pasteurized before drying to destroy harmful bacteria.<p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_milkpowder.jpg" ALT="Dried Skimmed Milk" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="135" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/milkpowder.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>There are several methods of dehydration.  In <B>spray drying</B>,fluid foods such as milk are sprayed into a stream of hot air, resulting in milk powder.  Liquid or pasty foods may be dried by applying them to hot stainless steel rolls, then scraping off the dry material at the end of a revolution.  <p>Freeze-drying is a sophisticated method of food dehydration. The water molecules in frozen food are vaporized, resulting in very little damage to the food.  This is an expensive procedure used mainly for convenience items such as instant coffee, or specialized foods such as mountaineering supplies or army rations.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 4  ------><B>Fermentation</B><p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_bacteria.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="132" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/bacteria.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>During fermentation, simple sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.  The choice of ingredients, as well as the sequence of operations, determine whether beer, wine or other liquors are produced. <p> Canada's wine industry is concentrated in the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario and the B.C. Interior.  New and hardier grape hybrids make it possible to harvest a good crop in Canada's limited growing season.  Wine is made all over the country from fruits. In Saskatchewan, local favorite wines are made from native  berries such as choke cherries and saskatoons.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 5  ------><B>Chemical Preservatives</B><p>The chemical preservation of food involves additives like sodium nitrite, the only food additive known to be effective against the microorganisms which cause botulism, or food-poisoning.  Sodium nitrite gives the characteristic pink colour to cured meats such as wieners and sausages.<p><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 6  ------><B>Freezing</B><p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_milk02.jpg" ALT="Ice cream" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="114" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/milk02.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Food preservation by freezing involves the same principles as preservation by drying.  Water is unavailable for the growth of harmful bacteria because it has become ice.  Different freezing systems freeze food at different rates, from slow to very fast.  The faster the freezing method, the less likely the food will suffer damage, or "freezer burn".<p>Frozen food has a limited lifetime in a kitchen refrigerator/freezer. Poorly packaged food will suffer freezer-burn as ice sublimates form the surface of the food.<!----- article 7  ------><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><B>Packaging</B><p>Modified Atmosphere Packaging is a process which prolongs the keeping qualities of baked goods, cheese and meats.  Food is packaged in an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide. <p> The carbon dioxide retards microbial growth, inhibiting the development of molds and keeping food fresher for longer.<p><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><B>Irradiation</B><p>Food irradiation is the only new preservation technology developed this century.  Various kinds of fruit, such as strawberries, may be irradiated by a stream of electrons, killing harmful microorganisms. No radiation is induced into the food by this process and no hazard to human health has ever been reported by this treatment. The process is especially useful in hospitals where some patients have to eat sterile meals.<p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><!----- article 8  ------><B>IMF</B><p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_imf.jpg" ALT="IMF Cookies" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="152" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/imf.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><p>A whole new class of foods, called intermediate moisture foods (IMF), have been developed as a result of the U.S. space exploration program.  <p>These foods--breakfast bars and snack foods, as well as pet food--are produced with the careful use of certain food additives.  The production of IMF foods is based on an increased scientific understanding of the chemical reactions involved in traditional food preservation methods such as pickling and salting. <p>IMF products are characterized by a semi-moist consistency.  These foods have enough moisture content to permit easy chewing but low enough water content to prevent spoilage.
