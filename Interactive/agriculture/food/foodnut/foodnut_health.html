This will also let the store know its customers want to buy Canadian. </UL><p><A NAME="age"><STRONG>Age, Exercise and Relaxation</STRONG></A><p>The amount and kind of food we need varies as we grow and age. Teenagers need extra nutrients to support the adolescent growth spurt, which begins in girls at ages 10 or 11, reaches its peak at age 12 and ends at about age 15. In boys, it begins at 12 or 13 years of age, peaks at 14 and ends at about 19. During this period of rapid growth, adequate amounts of iron and calcium are particularly important. From ages 11 to 24 years, both males and females should consume a calcium-rich diet (1,200 milligrams daily) in order to help ensure adequate calcium deposition in the bones during the age at which peak bone mass is attained. This may help reduce the incidence of osteoporosis in later years.<p>Teens' caloric needs vary depending on their growth rate, degree of physical maturation, body composition and activity level. Overweight is one of the most serious nutrition problems of adolescents, particularly among Native Americans, Hispanics and low-income African-Americans. <TABLE cellpadding= "11">	<TD valign="top"><embed src="../../../media/video/lisaroller.mov" height=135 width=180 loop=true controller=false autoplay=true></TD>	<TD><STRONG>Get Active!</STRONG><p>	If roller blading is not your choice - try walking. It is one of the safest ways to stay fit.	People who walk a lot in the course of their daily lives help to maintain a higher level of fitness than those who are more sedentary. If you can, walk or ride your bicycle rather than drive to school or work. </TD>.</TABLE><p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_relax.jpg" ALT="Relaxing" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="138" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><STRONG>Then Relax</STRONG><p>Getting some "R and R", or rest and relaxation, can significantly lower the stress from work or studies.  Surprisingly, the brain uses just as much energy when you are asleep, as when you are awake.  But the other systems of the body enjoy a good rest as much as you do.<p>Some of the physiological effects of relaxation are a slower heart rate,lower blood pressure, slower breathing and a drop in oxygen consumption.  Periods of relaxation make people more alert and better able to perform well at work.<!-- ########## COLUMN  END ########## --></td></tr></table><!-- ########## CONTENT TABLE END ########## --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOM NAV BUTTONS # # # # # # # # # # --><tr><td><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<a href="#pagetop" 		onmouseout="hi_off('TopImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('TopImg')">	<img name="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" height=20 	width=110 vspace="4" border="0" alt="return to top of page"></a></td><td></td><td><!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<a href = "./foodnut_energy.html" 		onmouseout="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<img align=left name="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border="0" 		alt="return to previous page"></a><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<a href = "../foodind/index.html" 		onmouseout="hi_off('NextImg')" 		onmouseover="hi_on('NextImg')">	<img align=right name="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	height=20 width=120 vspace="4" border="0" 		alt="go to next page"></a>	<!-- # # # # # # # # # #BOTTOM NAV END # # # # # # # # # # --></td></tr></td></tr></table><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></body></html>
