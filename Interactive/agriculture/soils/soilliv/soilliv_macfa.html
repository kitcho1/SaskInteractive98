While burrowing animals damage some crops,they also aerate the soil as they dig. These mammals addnutrients to the soil with their wastes, and some, such as the13-lined Ground Squirrel, help crops by eating harmful insectsand weed seeds.Soil macrofauna form part of the food web being important food sources for the higher predators such as birds of prey, wolves and coyotes. Insects and worms are very important in converting crop residues to soil organic matter which is rich in nutrients.<A NAME="Vertebrates"></A><H3><CENTER><P><B>Vertebrates</B><P></CENTER></H3><P>The most important vertebrates in soils are the <B>burrowing mammals</B>.The world of soil provides these animalswith shelter from their enemies and from extreme changes in climate.Burrowing animals such as ground squirrels, prairie dogs, andbadgers are important to the soil. As they dig tunnels and burrows,they loosen the soil, making larger pore spaces for air and water.</TD><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_gopher1.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="high resolution image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/gopher1.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><B>Prairie Dogs</B> are larger than more common gophers.They occupy fairly large amounts of land in communities knownas <B>towns</B>. Animals such as these are important to theprairie soil community because they contribute to the developmentof healthy soils.<P><B>Pocket Gophers</B> are another prairie mammal thatdigs burrows. They are often mistaken for moles because of thelarge piles of dirt they leave on the surface. Pocket gophershave large claws and teeth for digging, and they are able to closetheir mouths behind their front teeth, allowing them to dig without swallowing the soil.<P><P>The <B>Richardson Ground Squirrel</B> is one of themost common burrowing animals found on the Prairies. The Richardsonground squirrel lives mostly on the grasslands, often near greenvegetation and water. It digs burrows that have several openings.<P>Another ground squirrel found on the Prairies is the 13-linedground squirrel. It is a smaller animal, and has distinctive lineson its back. The 13-lined ground squirrel also digs burrows,although it often hides the openings, making them harder to find.<P><A NAME="Arthropods"></A><CENTER><H3><P><B>Arthropods</B><P></H3></CENTER>Arthropods are animals that have legs with separate joints like our own. Insects, spiders, crabs,and millipedes are arthropods. All arthropods belong toa larger group of animals called invertebrates - animals without backbones. Other invertebrates include snails, slugs, earthworms, but these are not arthropods because they do not have jointed legs.In the macrofauna group arthropoda include many insects from ants to woodlice. Most play an important role in degrading plant residues and as important members of the <A HREF="soilliv_web.html">food web</A>.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_carpant.jpg"><P><B>The Ant</B><P>Have you ever watched several ants march alongthe same trail, and wondered how they know where they are going?Ants leave chemical clues along the ground to mark their way toand from their nest. Ants live in the soil and depend on otherorganisms for their food and search for food on flowers. Ant nests can be found in some gardens by lifting rocks or bricks. Colonies of thousands move soil and build tunnels. Ants contribute to soil-building and add organic matter to the soil. They are scavengers, recycling dead matter.<P>At the beginning of their adult life, mostants have wings and in fact belong to the same family (Hymenoptera) as bees and wasps. The mating of winged male and female ants takesplace during flight, after which the male dies. The female returnsto the ground, removes her wings either by rubbing or biting themoff, and proceeds to start a new colony. Some female ants have been known to lay fertilizedeggs throughout a period of 15 years, after mating only once.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_tigerbeet.jpg"><P><B>Beetles</B><P>One of the more conspicuous members of the soil society is the beetle. This group of insects has hard outer wings which help protect them from predators. There are several types of beetles that live in the ground. Ground beetles and tiger beetles help to mix the soil and they contribute to the organic matter content of the soil.  Certain species of ground beetles have neverseen light. They live in small pockets in the soil and never cometo the surface. Many ground beetles however, live amongst theleaf litter.<P>Adult ground beetles are carnivorous. Theyattack springtails, earthworms, snails and various other inhabitantsof the topsoil. When hunting, ground beetles remain perfectlystill and wait for potential "meals" to move into attackingrange.<P>Although quite common, you must be quick tosee either the larva or the adult of the tiger beetle. The larvae,which live in burrows in the soil, retreat at the slightest vibrationin the ground. Adult tiger beetles has long slender legs whichhelp them move extremely fast along the ground. <P>Tiger beetles are meat eaters in both lifestages. <I>Take a look at that ferocious head in the image!</I> The larvae sit quietly in their burrows and are readyto seize insects as they crawl close to the openings of theirholes. When the soil become dry, tiger beetles plugthe openings of their burrows to prevent their bodies from dryingout.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_millipede.jpg"><P><B>Centipedes and Millipedes</B><P>Centipedes and millipedes differ from one anotherin their eating habits. Centipedes have a large set of poisonclaws just below the mouth, which make them efficient meat eaters.Millipedes are vegetarians. They usually prefer rotting plantmaterial to flesh. Their bodies act like little grinding machines,that break up a great deal of the soil litter layer. Their eating habits help to increase the organic content of the soil.<P>Both centipedes and millipedes have curiousmethods of defense. When attacked and held by a leg or two, thecentipede simply releases the legs. They continue to vibrate whenthey are not attached to the body. This adaption diverts the predator'sattention while the centipede escapes serious harm.<P>When a hungry predator, like a toad or spider,approaches a millipede, it simply rolls into a spiral -- legsto the inside, hard shell to the outside. But, the greatest adaptationfor the millipede is its terrible taste caused by stink glands-- its ultimate weapon of defense.<P>Although millipedes have more legs (two pairs per body segment)than centipedes (one pair per body segment), they move considerablyslower.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_sowbug.jpg"><P><B>The Sow Bug</B><P>The sow bug (also called the wood&nbsp;louse or pill&nbsp;bug) is a relative to both the freshwater crayfish and saltwaterlobster. You can find them under stones, boards, rotting wood,and other damp dark places. Sow bugs cannot live if exposed todirect sunlight, even if for a short period of time.<P><P>A sow bug can roll itself up in its protectiveshell to protect itself from predators and dry conditions. Whenrolled up, it resembles a pill, hence the name "pill&nbsp;bug".<P>Sow bugs play an important role in chewingup plant material and mixing material in the top layer of soil.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_cicada.jpg"><P><B>The Cricket and Cicada</B><P>Crickets and cicadas are two other arthropods (in addition to beetles) which inhabit the soil. Crickets are efficient diggers. In fact, <b>mole crickets</B> get their name from their frontlegs which resemble those of a mole. They are adapted for digging,and are strong and curved outward. These types of insects help mix the soil.Mole crickets feed on the <A HREF="soilliv_macfl.html">roots</A> of plants.They live in small tunnels beneath the surface of the soil wherethey spend most of their lives.At night, the males sing by rubbing their firstpair of wings together. the sound closely resembles the distantquacking of ducks! <P><P><b>Cicadas</B> spend most of their life in the soil.They live anywhere from four to twenty years as nymphs underground,where they feed on juices from the roots of plants.When ready, cicada nymphs dig to the surface,and climb some sturdy object such as the trunk of a tree. Theirskin splits down the back and the winged adult emerges.  On a hot summer day, you may have heard thepiercing buzz of the male cicada. This is a mating signal to attractfemales, which are silent.<P>In wet weather, cicada nymphs have been knownto build small towers over their exit holes apparentlyin an attempt to overcome excess moisture. As with the cricket, they aid in the mixing of the soil.<P><A NAME="Annelida"></A><CENTER><H3><P><B>Annelida</B><P></H3></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=270 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_earthworm.jpg"><P><B>The Earthworm</B><P>Earthworms belong to the group of segmented worms.  As <b>underground engineers</b>, they eat their way through the soil.The 'meal' passes through the entire length of their body. The excrementof <b>worm casts</B> they deposit help create a more fertilesoil. As a result of their eating habits, earthwormscreate a complex network of underground tunnels, which help airand water circulate through the soil to plant roots and otherliving organisms.Adult earthworms are only about ten centimetres long, but a colony of them cancompletely turn over the top ten centimetres of soil in just afew years. Earthworms spend most of their lives underground wherethey make burrows that can penetrate deeply into the soil.  In the winter, earthworms retreat to deep belowthe frost line, to avoid the killing cold. In spring, these soil-builders emerge. You can usually see worms whenyou turn over the soil in your garden.  <P>Underground, the earthworm builds burrows that have smooth walls cemented together with mucus and otherexcretions. Although some burrows have been found more than ametre underground, most are near the surface where they serveas passage for air and water. The burrows also help loosen thesoil, making it easier for plant roots to grow in that area.<P>Earthworms breathe through theirskin so after a heavy rain, you will see these worms emerging from their homes. If they did not come to the surface in the rain they wouldsuffocate.<P>Earthworms feed on dead and decaying plantson or near the surface of the soil. This material is digestedand later left behind as a ground-up mulch. In this way,earthworms add organic matter to the soil, making it more availableto smaller organisms and plants.<P>If you put an earthworm on a piece of paper,you will hear scratching sounds as it moves. Earthworms crawlwith the aid of tiny, paired still hairs on their skin, much like thebristles on the end of a broom. These hairs found on almost every segment of the worm's body are called <b>setae</b>. The setae help the earthworm to grip and move through the soil.<P> An earthworm's life is full ofdanger. Worms are hunted by robins, gulls, owls, and even snakesand foxes. Moles and shrews are other predators. Earthworms haveno eyes or ears but they do have very sensitive skin, which warnsthem of predators nearby. When an earthworm senses movement nearbyit moves away from the source of the vibrations. <P>The blue-colouredend of the earthworm contains its most important organs, includingits brain, heart, and reproductive organs.<P>Humans create hazards for earthworms, too.When people cultivate the soil they expose earthworms to predatorsand disturb their feeding and breeding areas.<P>The prairie climate is not ideal for earthworms.They must burrow deep into the soil to avoid winter cold and summerheat. In very dry areas, there are few or no earthworms. In fact,earthworms are not a natural part of the prairie environment.They arrived on the Prairies with settlers who brought plantsfrom Europe, or sometimes they were brought by gardeners who knewthe worms were good soil-builders. Earthworms on the Prairiesare found mostly in urban areas, in gardens, parks, and golf courses.<P>Earthworms are important soil-buildersin the areas where they now live, but in most parts of the Prairiesother organisms play this role. Worm-like creatures callednematodes, and various kinds of beetles tunnel through the topsoil,churning and aerating the soil, improving drainage, consumingdead organic matter, and providing food for larger consumers.<P><P><P><A NAME="Mollusca"></A><CENTER><B><H3>Mollusca</H3></B></CENTER><P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><BR><IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_bananaslug.jpg"><P><B>Snails and Slugs</B><P>The snail and slug are two specially adapted soil dwellers. They feed on plant material and help to ad organic matter to the soil.Both snails and slugs have a soft upper bodyresting on a singular muscular <B>foot</B> that runs theirentire length. A gland near the front edge of the foot secretesa slime that lubricates the foot and prevents its delicate surfacefrom being torn.<P>Snails and slugs can move at speeds of over30 cm per hour. At this rate, it would take a snail over 170 yearsto travel from Toronto to Ottawa!<P><P>Slugs and snails are sensitive to light andsound, and have a well-developed sense of smell. They also havelong sensory tentacles at the front of their body, which are used similarto the way a blind person uses a white cane.The snail's shell in his home, defense againstpredators, and protection from adverse environmental conditionssuch as drought. When winter approaches, snails withdraw intotheir shells, seal the open end with fast-drying mucus, and await the return of warm weather.<BR><P>Instead of using a shell for protection, slugsare covered with a slimy substance which allows them to crawlunder litter and stones and into small cracks in the soil. Slugs are considered pests in some gardens as they chew plant material, effectively killing the plant. Slime trails of slugs may be seen in an infested flower bed. Although no one can say that a slug is pretty, some are quite colorful like this Banana slug from the forests of British Columbia. <P></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><TABLE WIDTH=435 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><I>Thanks to the University of Missouri and Sarah Heyman and Jan Weaver, (http://www.missouri.edu/~bioscish/) and also to Scott Camazine, Department of Entomology, Penn State University for the use of some of these images.
