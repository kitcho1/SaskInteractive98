The reactions require energy of some kind (either a gain or loss). New substances may be formed when bonds between atoms or <B>ions</B> are formed, broken or when atoms are rearranged. Ions are atoms which are positively or negatively charged by either losingor gaining electrons. Ions with different charges have an attractiveforce for each other, while similarly charged ions repel one another.One example of a chemical reaction is hydrogen uniting with oxygento form water. <P>An understanding of soil chemistry is important in soil formation and fertility. How rocks and minerals breakdown and transform into new compounds is essential to our understanding of weathering and erosion. How mineral nutrients are transformed and bound in soil leads to better fertilization and soil testing techniques.

A pH scale ranges from strongly acidic (pH of 0) to strongly basic (pH of 14). Each numerical increase on the scale is an actual jump in pH value 10-fold.  Most soils are within apH range from 4.5 (considered strongly acidic for soils) to 8.5(medium alkaline). The best growth for the greatest variety ofplants takes place within a 6.0 to 7.0 pH range (slightly acidicto neutral). Some plants thrive in an alkaline environment while other prefer more acidic soils. <P>While the pH of soils may have some direct effects on plantsthemselves, it is the interaction of soil pH and plant nutrients that is important. Soils which are higher in acidity or alkalinitylevels can result in deficiencies or excesses (that may be toxic)of certain kinds of elements.  For instance, higher alkalinity can make elementssuch as iron, manganese and zinc less soluble and therefore lessavailable for plant absorption. Deficiencies of these elementscan cause poor growth and poor plant health. Higher acidity can result in a higher percentage of certain substances that are absorbed in solution by plants.<P>The pH of a soil can affectthe activities of microorganisms, which then affects the level of nitrogen,phosphorus and sulphur in the soil.  As with plants, most organisms prefer a near-neutral range.Outside this range, the numbers of microorganisms and the ratesof their biochemical activities decrease. This affects certainnutrient levels as bacteria and other life forms are involvedin decomposition and cycling of matter. Plant producers may use soil pHto help determine soil nutrients that may be lacking and the appropriate way to help the problem.<P><B>Acidification</B><P><P>In many areas of the province, soils have experiencedan increase in acidity. Acidification may be the result of the following:<UL><LI>In forested or parkland areas, where thereis a greater amount of vegetation combined with moist and warmconditions, decomposition releases carbon dioxide. This combineswith soil moisture to form carbonic acid. <LI>Acid rain isformed by water combining with the emissions of gases (sulphurdioxide) from thermal electric sites and oil refining operations.Soils, within a radius of many kilometres, can be affected, dependingon prevailing wind directions and velocities. In Saskatchewan,acid rain is not a major contributor to acidification at the present time. <LI>Some chemical fertilizers enteringinto solution in the soil will produce acidic compounds. Greaterapplications of particular kinds of fertilizers are increasingsoil acidity in some areas.</UL><P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_salirr.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/salirr.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><A NAME="salt"></A><B>Salinity</B><P> Driving along the Trans-Canada Highway near Swift Current is an experience. In the middle of summer, it appears that the land is covered by snow. The 'snow' is actually an accumulation of soluble salts at the soil surface. These salts are depositedwhen the water which had carried them evaporates. Saline areascan develop from upward capillary movements of water, groundwater seepage, internal drainage,  and water tables being close to the surface.  In all cases, salts that are naturally found int he ground are brought to the surface as dissolved substances in water. As the water evaporates, the salts are left behind, thereby increasing  the salinity of the soil.<P>Higher salt levels negatively affect plantsand soil organisms. At a cellular level, a higher concentration of salt outside cells means that there is a lower concentrationof <B>water</B> outside the cells. This can interfere with water intake.The process of <B>osmosis</B> is water moving from an area of higher water concentration to an area oflower concentrations through a membrane.<P> In non-salinesoils, water usually moves from the soil into the cells. If a salty soil hasabout the same or lower water concentration than living cells,water may leave the cells. The result of water leaving the cells is a plant which wilts and eventually dies, from lack of water intake. Salts may enter the cells and can interfere with theintake of needed nutrients by the cells or have toxic effects on the cells. Small soil organisms are similarly affected by high salt concentrations in the soil.<P>Salts also affect the structure of soils by causing soil clumps to break down more quickly. This leadsto soil layers becoming more dense, restricting air and watermovements and making conditions less favourable for plant roots andmicroorganisms.<P>The term <B>alkali </B>is often used in referringto saline areas. While the term is not necessarily incorrect,alkali is just one form of salinity. There are different kindsof salts in soils; the more common ones being calcium and magnesium.Sodium is another salt found in soils and, if concentrated inthe upper soil, the accumulation is called <B>alkalinization.</B> Alkali soil behave like clayey soils; they are sticky when wet, usually crusty on the surface and when  dry,  becomeshard.  			</TD>	</TR>	</FONT></TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT END ########## -->	<BR><!-- ########## WHITEPAGE END######### -->	</TD>	</TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD WIDTH=138><TABLE WIDTH=127 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to TOP OF PAGE"></A>	</TD>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION --><TD WIDTH=450>	<A HREF = "../soilphys/soilphys_wat.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to PREVIOUS PAGE"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "../soilliv/index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4" ALT="Go to NEXT PAGE"></A>	</TD>	</TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
