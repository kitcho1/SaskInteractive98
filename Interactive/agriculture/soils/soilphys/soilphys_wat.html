On a local scale, how well the soil stores water is of great importance to crop production and the vitality of the land. In the Prairie region of Canada, in particular, the single most important factor in crop  production is available water. (i.e water stored in the soil plus effective precipitation  over the growing season).<br><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><CENTER><H3>Soil Water</H3></CENTER><P>In order to understand soil water we have to perform a simple experiment. Take a sponge and soak it in water. Pick up the sponge and excess water will flow out of it due to <I>gravity</I>. Squeeze the sponge and more water flows. If you  squeeze it as hard as you can a little more water flows but finally we can squeeze it no more. But if we wrap the sponge in a paper towel and squeeze the towel becomes damp. What we are seeing is the effect of surface tension and <I>capillary action</I>. Water is held in soil in pores of various sizes. The large pores readily lose water at the slightest squeeze but it becomes more difficult to remove water from the tiny pores. <P>In air dry soils the water that remains is loosely bonded to the surface of minerals and we need to put the soil in an oven to remove this type of water.<P> Soil water, therefore can be  classified into three categories: <OL TYPE="1" START="1">	<LI>gravitational water or excess water - drains from the soil after a rainfall or irrigation.	<LI>capillary water - contained in small pores or as films around particles.	<LI>hygroscopic water - in air dry soils, as layers on minerals, several molecules thick</OL><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=220 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/capaction.jpg">Capillary forces can be illustrated by a two capillary tubes of different diameters dipped in a beaker of water. The water in the capillary tube with the smallest diameter will rise the highest. The water rises due to  surface tension of the water. For capillary action to occur, the water must be under negative pressure (or suction). The arrangement and distribution of soil pores is very  complex but nonetheless a plant must exert considerable suction to remove water from the soil.  In some instances the plant may not be  able to exert enough suction to remove water from the  tiny pores and it will wilt and die. Even at this stage the  soil may contain large quantities of stored water but retained at great suctions. For example a dry soil  on which the crop has wilted still holds several millions of kg of water per hectare.  <p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><H3>Soil Water Energy</H3><P>Rather than thinking of tension or suction, we can also think of water as being held by the soil particles in terms of <B>energy</B>. This is an important consideration because if we want to understand how water moves in soils we know that it will <I>move from regions of high to regions of low energy</I>. <P>There are three forces which contribute to the energy state of soil water:<P> <P><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/waterpot.jpg"><B>Gravitational</B> water has a <I>positive energy</I> and can flow out of the soil through the large pores. <B>Osmotic</B> potential is due to the attraction that salts have for water through the phenomenon of osmosis. This energy is <I>negative</I>relative to free water. Finally, the potential energy of water attracted to soil solids is called the <B>Matric</B> potential. It too is <I>negative</I>.<P>In an unsaturated soil, matric potential results from the capillarity and adhesion forces. Plants must overcome the energy of matric potential to extract water from the soil. How do we know how much water is available in a soil? For every soil there is a different distribution of pores of various sizes. Also we have different salt contents and <A HREF="soilphys_sep.html">separates</A>. All of these factors will determine the energy at which the water is held. Most importantly, is the energy changes as the soil dries out because the plant can exert only so much suction.<P>All of these properties are reflected in the soils <B>moisture retention curve</B>.<IMG WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=333 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/moistretcurv.jpg"><P>Note the typical S-shaped curve with the log axis for <I>matric potential</I>.  There are two important points on the curve:<P><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI><B>Field Capacity</B> - approximately -30kPa (in reality varies 5-40kPa). The matric potential of the soil one to three days after a heavy rainfall when all gravitational water	has moved downwards.	<LI><B>Permanent Wilting Point</B> - approximately -1500 kPa for most crops. The matric potential at which the plant can 	no longer remove water and permanently wilts. In reality many plants wilt in the daytime but recover at night 	when not actively transpiring. Even at this potential many <B>xerophytic</B> plants can still extract water.	<LI><B>Available water</B> - is the amount of water held by the soil at potentials <I>between the field capacity and permanent wilting point.</I></UL><p><hr noshade size="1" width="96%"><br><CENTER><H3>Available Water Capacities</H3></CENTER><P>A major soil characteristic that affects available water is soil texture as seen in the following table:                                                                            <P><TABLE WIDTH=450 BORDER=2 BGCOLOR="#CCCC99"><CAPTION><B>Soil moisture content  at Field Capacity and Permanent Wilting Point for soils of different textures</B></CAPTION>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="95">         <P><B>Texture</B>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><B>Field Capacity (% vol)</B></CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><B>Perm.

Any dissolved nutrients or chemicals move with the water and can eventually end up polluting the ground water.<P> How do you calculate the available water in a soil profile i.e. the available water to certain depth say 120 cm (4 feet)?. The concept of inches of water per foot of soil depth (cm water per 30 cm soil depth) is used.<P><P><TABLE WIDTH=450 BORDER=2 BGCOLOR="#CCCC99"><CAPTION><B>Available soil moisture at field capacity moisture content</B></CAPTION>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="130">         <P><B>Soil Texture</B>      </TD><TD WIDTH="164">         <P><CENTER><B>Available Water</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>(in water per foot soil)</B></CENTER>      </TD><TD>            <P><CENTER><B>Available Water</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><CENTER><B>(cm water per 30 cm soil)</B></CENTER>                </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="130">         <P>Coarse (Sand)      </TD><TD WIDTH="164">         <P><CENTER>1</CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER>2.5</CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="130">         <P>Medium (Loam)      </TD><TD WIDTH="164">         <P><CENTER>1.5</CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER>3.8</CENTER>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD WIDTH="130">         <P>Fine (Clay)      </TD><TD WIDTH="164">         <P><CENTER>2</CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER>5</CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE><P>A sandy soil at field capacity moisture content would hold 1 inch of water per foot of soil or 4 inches (10cm) if the soil was wet to a depth of four feet.
