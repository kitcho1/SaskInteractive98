Other soil organisms (heterotrophs) consume the organic residues of plants and animals converting them back to CO<SUB>2</SUB> which eventually finds its way back into the atmosphere in a continuous carbon cycle.<P>In Saskatchewan, the amount of carbon (organic matter) in the soil is readily recognized by the colour of the surface horizons and gives rise to the <A HREF="../soilenv/soilenv_zone.html">soil zones</A><P>Soil organic matter contains about 50% carbon, 40% oxygen, 5% hydrogen, 4% nitrogen, 1% sulphur. Most of the other mineral nutrients are also associated in some way with organic matter: some as exchangeable cations and anions, cation bridges, or simply adsorbed on the surface.<P><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=210 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/t_actfrac.jpg">Organic matter can be separated into two main components: the <B>active fraction</B>, which turns over in period of10 to 25 years and a <B>passive fraction</B> which turns over in hundreds to thousands of years. The active fraction is the part responsible for nutrient cycling and is composed of living organisms, their metabolites and decaying plant and animal residues. The passive fraction is the more humified material that has undergone mainly reactions that condense and polymerize the carbon compounds to produce resistant material to microbial degradation. Carbon dating of soil organic matter fractions have shown some to be older than 3000 years.<P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_blacksoil.jpg"><P><B>Losses of Organic Matter</B><P>In a natural grassland or forest ecosystem, soil organic matter accumulates with soil development and eventually arrives at an equilibrium which is mainly determined by the environment and natural vegetation. In Saskatchewan soils with the most amount of organic matter (not peats) are found in the Black <A HREF="../soilenv/soilenv_zone.html">soil zone</A> (see image). These soils are also the most fertile. Unfortunately, once the soil is tilled and cropped massive changes occur within the soil system. Long-term studies show that organic-matter levels of many soils havedeclined to about half of what was present when they were first tilled. Even when livestock manure and green manure crops have been added, organicmatter has declined. We have, in fact, been mining our soils! Tillage mixes oxygen into the soil and breaks up structure, giving microbes all they need to burn uporganic matter and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. <P>In the natural state much of the organic matter is protected. Think of the soil system as millions of tiny pores of all sizes and shapes.. Much of the organic matter is trapped in areas inaccessible to microbes.  Other organic matter particles are clumped together allowing microbes access to the outside while the centre remainsprotected. Tillage changes all this, like a large  mix master, stirring and churning mixing everything together. Microbes suddenly find a feast and proceed to multiply spitting out excess nutrients that if not taken up by the crop get leached out of the soil.<P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/crops/t_burn01.jpg"><P><B>Managing Organic Matter</B><P>Research is clear. Anytime you drag a plough through soil you will lose organic matter despite additions of manure and crop residues. It is also clear that cropped land will have a lower organic matter content than the virgin grassland. The question is: what is tolerable?<P>In some parts of the province and many other parts of the world, land is cropped that is best left alone or put to pasture. In many instances, land such as this is broken and supports crops for only a few years before it becomes uneconomical to continue. The <B>slash and burn</B> type of agriculture practised in the rainforest is an example. Forests are cleared and the trees and detritus burned. Crops are planted into a very thin soil with low organic matter content. The organic matter rapidly depletes and the soil becomes subject to erosion, washing away and adding huge amounts of sediment to the lakes and rivers - an environmental catastrophe. In parts of Saskatchewan, particularly the southwest, the natural vegetation is very sparse, so why would we think that we could produce good crops over the long term? Particularly without irrigation.<P>Are there any ways to minimise organic matter losses? Yes, there are - but no method has proven as effective as mother nature. The government has tried to promote <I>conservation farming practices</I> which include:<UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>Avoid summerfallow where possible. Some areas need to summerfallow to conserve soil moisture and help control pests.	<LI>Use permanent crop covers to prevent erosion add organic matter.	<LI>Employ crop rotations that include forages and legumes	<LI>Add manures, sewage sludge and organic wastes to supplement crop residues	<LI>Use an adequate and balanced fertilizer program which creates healthy crops and good residues. 	<LI>Try zero till where possible. In zero till, the seed is drilled directly into stubble without first plowing the soil.</UL>			</TD>	</TR></TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT END ########## -->	<BR><!-- ########## WHITEPAGE END######### -->	</TD>	</TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD width=138><TABLE WIDTH=127 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to TOP OF PAGE"></A>	</TD>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION --><TD width=450>	<A HREF = "./index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to PREVIOUS PAGE"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "./soilman_eros.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4" ALT="Go to NEXT PAGE"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
