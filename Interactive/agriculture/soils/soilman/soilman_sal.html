Farmers refer to saline soils by several names including <I>Alkali and Burn-out</I>. What is a saline soil? It is a soil that contains a high concentration of soluble salts such as sodium magnesium and calcium sulphates with lesser amounts of chlorides.Saline soils can be caused by contamination of normal soils by saline groundwater or spills or by development on saline parent material (<A HREF="../soilenv/soilenv_can.html">Solonetzic Order</A>)</TD><tr><td width=442 valign="top"><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/t_soilsal.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/drawings/agriculture/soilsal.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><B>Salinization Process</B><P>Saline soils are naturally occurring in Saskatchewan but can also be caused by poor irrigation practice.   Saline soils result from the buildup of soluble salts inthe soil. Ground water pressure maintains the water table closeto the soil surface. Water moves by capillary action to the soilsurface, bringing with it dissolved salts. When the water evaporates from the surface, these salts are left behind.Because evaporation exceeds precipitation in semi-aridclimates, salts tend to build up particularly in the upper soil layers in low lying areas during dry periods. The excess salts (usually calcium sulphate) cause many types of crops to wither and die literally by starving them for water as a result of high osmotic pressure. Several factors cause salt to rise to the surface.<UL><LI><B>Regional Geology</B> -  Artesian discharge from aquifers of both glacial and bedrock origin is the major factor responsible for high water tables and soil salinization inSaskatchewan (<B>see image</B>). <LI><B>Climate</B> - Low annual rainfall during the spring and summer months at a time of high evaporation and crop growth may lead to increased water movement to the surface. The surface water then evaporates  and salts are left behind. This increase surface soil salinity. <LI><B>Summerfallowing</B> - This practice is designed to conserve moisture in the soil,but it also allows salts dissolved in water from the subsoil to rise to the surface. </UL> <P>Saline soils have become an increasing problem over the years, due, in part, to traditional farming practices and construction activity  which disrupts normal groundwater flow.  Road construction and dam building are two activities associated with this problem.<P> As water percolates through the soil, it dissolves the salts that are present in the soil. If the water carrying these salts move to the surface and evaporates, the salts are deposited at or close to the soil surface. A residue of dry salt is left once the water has evaporated.<P>Saline soils are a problem because the salts prevent plant roots from making use of water in the soil.   Plant roots absorb water from the soil through the process of <b>osmosis</B>. Osmosis moves water  from an area of lower salt (higher water) concentration to an area of higher salt (lower water) concentration.  The salt concentration inside a normal plant cell is about 1.5%, so that water moves <b>into</B> root cells.   In saline soils, the concentration of salt is the soil water can rise above 1.5% and prevent osmosis   from moving water into the roots. It may cause water to move out of the root, thereby dehydrating the plant.<P>High salt content in the soil also causes nutrient deficiencies. <P><I>Saline soils are characterized by high levels of salt and normal (neutral) pH levels. </I><tr><td width=442 valign="top"><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_em38.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/em38.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><B> Measuring Soil Salinity </B> <P>Soil salinity can be mapped in the field using an instrument called the <B>EM38 earth conductivity meter</B>.  This instrument can be moved back and forth over the field and give a reading over the salinity electromagnetically. Soil salinity is usually determined as part of a routine soil test. Since salinity varies with depth it is very useful to send in soil samples that represent at least the surface soil (0-15cm), and sub soil (15-60cm). The results will then give us a <I>salinity profile</I>. The salts are extracted from soil by water in a saturation extract. The conductivity of the extract is then measured using a conductivity bridge. The more salt present the higher will  be the conductivity. A value of 0-4 decisiemens/m (ds/m) is considered non saline to slightly saline.  A value of 4-8 ds/m moderately saline and 8-16 ds/m severely saline. <P> If the pH of the extract is > 8.5, and structure of the subsoil is hard and compacted suggesting a Bnt horizon or excess exchangeable sodium, then  the ESP (Exchangeable Sodium Percentage) can be determined. This is the percentage of the soil's Cation Exchange Capacity occupied by sodium. An ESP of 15 % or greater is considered a sodic soil and needs special management practices.<tr><td width=442 valign="top"><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/t_salirr.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/soils/salirr.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><B>Management of Saline Soils</B><P>Saline soils must be managed with great care otherwise serious problems can persist for many years. The problem can spread rapidly and affect neighbour's fields or contaminate the local watershed or groundwater.

If the soil is worked when it is too wet, the structure breaks down and completely. If tillage isleft too late, the soil bakes and it becomes almost impossible to get proper penetration of tillage implements.Deep plowing or deep ripping is a management practice designed to break up the compact Bnt horizon which resists penetration by plant roots. Usually done to a depth of 45-75 cm (18-30 in), this practice has proven beneficial in parts ofAlberta and North Dakota and, more recently, in the Weyburn area of Saskatchewan.However, deep plowing at insufficient depth or wherethe subsoil is very saline or stoney can do more harm than good. Deep ripping needs special equipment (<B>see image</B>) pulled by a powerful tractor. Deep plowing is not a management or reclamation practice for saline soils.<P><B>Alkalinity</B><P>Salinity need not be confused with the term <b>alkalinity</B>. True <B>Alkali</B> soils rarely occur in Saskatchewan. They develop where the parent material is high in <b>sodium</B>. During the process of weathering, sodium is released from the mineral structure of shale. This process raises the pH (lowers the acidity) of the soil to the point where it becomes alkaline.  The sodium ions cause the soil particles to lose their aggregation and pack tightly together.  This packing closes the soil pores which then inhibits air and water movement.   Alkali soils are characterized by a high pH  (>8.5), high sodium concentrations and a dense soil layer  that does not permit water to penetrate. Often the sodium and high pH causes some soil organic matter to dissolve  which forms a black layer on the surface. These are called <I>Black Alkali</I> Soils.  There are few true alkali soil areas in this province. <P>			</TD>	</TR>	</FONT></TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT END ########## -->	<BR><!-- ########## WHITEPAGE END######### -->	</TD>	</TR>	</tr><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD width=138><TABLE WIDTH=127 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to TOP OF PAGE"></A>	</TD>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION --><TD width=450>	<A HREF = "./soilman_eros.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4"	ALT="Return to PREVIOUS PAGE"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "../../sustain/index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 vspace="4" ALT="Go to NEXT PAGE"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
