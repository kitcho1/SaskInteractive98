These are ideas that are taken from the  Agriculture Saskatchewan series by Saskatchewan Education.</TD></TABLE><br><p><B>Activity 1</B><P>Explore the agricultural history of your area of the province.As a class, brainstorm some research options. Some suggestionsmay be: local museums, local inhabitants, local history booksand the Saskatchewan Historical Society. Brainstorm some questionsto answer such as:<BR><P><UL><LI>Who were the first settlers? <LI>Why did they leave their homes? <LI>Whydid they choose to settle in your area? <LI>How large were the farms?<LI>Where and when did the first settlers locate? <LI>How were the namesof neighbouring towns and villages chosen? <LI>How would early settlersfeel when they first came to live here? <LI>Did any people leave?Why?<LI>Why did those who stayed decide to remain?</UL><BR>  <P><B>Activity 2</B><P>Early settlers often created their own entertainment. Share ideas of what types of entertainmentsettlers created. Jug bands, string bands and homemade instrumentswere often a part of rural tradition. Work in pairsto design and create your own musical instruments, using foundobjects salvaged from the immediate environment. For example,you may carve wood, weld iron, use rebar or cut copper pipesto different lengths to make percussion instruments.<BR><P><B>Activity 3</B><P>Reflect on life in Saskatchewan during the1930s. Review the rules for brainstorming and then brainstormwith the class to record some observations about weather, economicand social conditions during this time. The following are someexamples.<BR><UL><LI>world economic depression<LI>drought<LI>low prices for produce<LI>unemployment dust storms</UL><P><B>Activity 4</B><P>Participate in a focused imaging activity to visualizelife during the 1930s. Some suggested phrasesare given below.<BR><P><I>Sit comfortably. Relax. Breathe in deeply through your nose, outthrough your mouth. (Repeat three times). You are outside in afarm yard. It is 1933 and very dry and windy. It is your birthday.(Breathe in deeply, and out.) Last year you received some clothesyour mother had remade from some clothing sent from the East.This year there is even less available. Listen to the wind, smellthe dust in the air. What are you thinking? How do you feel?(This can continue ...)</I><BR><P>Record in a journal writing format your reflectionsas if you were living in southern Saskatchewan at that time.Put yourself in a situation such as movingfrom southern Saskatchewan to northern Saskatchewan, celebratingChristmas or birthdays, watching a dust storm or knowing therewould be no crop and no money ... again.<BR><P><B>Activity 5</B><P>The federal government encouraged the Indian peoples to establishagriculture on their reserves. Metis people farmed as well. With a small group, investigate the history of Indian agriculture using the following subtopics as a guide.<BR><P>Trace the early history of Indian and Metis agriculture in Saskatchewan.<UL><LI>What encouragement and constraints were presented by the federalgovernment to Indian people and by the provincial government toMetis people participating in agricultural activities?<LI>What is happening today in the area of Indian and Metis agriculture?<LI>What is the Saskatchewan Indian Agriculture Program (SIAP)and what impact has it had on the Aboriginal peoples in Saskatchewan?<LI>What effect could the land claims presently in dispute inSaskatchewan have on Saskatchewan agricultural operations?</UL><P><B>Activity 6</B><P>Develop a historical cookbook. Talkto your parents, grandparents and friends about old recipes thathave been used by your families over the years. Include all cultures.Visit the senior housing and extended care facilities in yourarea to talk to people there about what they used to eat. Includetheir comments and reflections in the book. Publish the recipesand other information gathered in cookbook form. You may want to form committees to carry out the following activities.<BR><UL><LI>Prepare and administer a budget.<LI>Develop artwork for the cover and inside pages.<LI>Sort the recipes and decide on the categories.<LI>Proofread recipes.<LI>Develop a marketing strategy if the book is used as a schoolfundraising project.</UL><P><B>Activity 7</B><P> Bring any items to school that have beenused in the past by your families or friends. Find out the name of the item, how it was used, when it was usedand what we use today that accomplishes the same task. A comparisonof efficiencies of the present and former items may be interesting.These items could be displayed in an attractive manner with labelledcards outlining the information you have found. Part of thedisplay could be a background mural created by students onlarge sheets of paper. This mural could trace the history of Saskatchewandevelopment, including some written commentary about the itemsdisplayed or about what was occurring economically and sociallyin Saskatchewan during the years depicted in the mural. Some researchinto Saskatchewan history will be required prior to this activity.<P><B>Activity 8</B><P>Early settlers coming west often used oxen to transport theirpossessions. Do research in your school resourcecentre to discover why oxen were used instead of horses and howlong it would take the settlers to travel west. Establish a probable starting point and use the area in whichyou live as the ending point. You may discover some of thesefacts.<BR><UL><LI>Settlers travelled in early spring at a rate of 27 kilometresper day if they used oxen and 45 kilometres per day if they usedhorses.<LI>Oxen could carry 225 kilograms to 350 kilograms in carts;horses could carry 680 kilograms.<LI>Many settlers used oxen instead of horses.<LI>Oxen were slower and more difficult to handle but they couldlive off the land. Horses need grain and grass to stay healthy.<LI>Oxen were cheaper than horses.<LI>Oxen did not depreciate with age as horses did.<LI>Ox beef was tough but well flavoured and a good source ofprotein.<LI>Horses were viewed as the cadillac of draught animals</UL><P><P>The activity could be completed by comparing the horse and oxto the tractor.<P><B>Activity 9</B><P>Work in groups of three or four to researchthe five Indian nations in what is now Saskatchewan and theirearly agricultural practices. The five Indian nations are Cree,Nakota (Assiniboine), Dakota (Sioux), Dene (Chipeweyan) and Anishinabeg(Saulteaux). Discuss available resources for the project withthe teacher librarian prior to the assignment. Use one periodto research, one to prepare the assignment and one to report tothe class. Some questions that could be discussed are:<BR><UL><LI>Which Indian nations lived where?<LI>What was their food?<LI>How was this food obtained? What differences in lifestylethen made this possible?<LI>Was agriculture a part of their lives?<LI>Why or why not?<LI>How would a nomadic lifestyle differ from the lifestyle ofa stable agricultural settlement?<LI>Did changes occur after explorers and fur traders arrivedhere?<LI>Are there advantages to being a farmer of Indian heritage?Are there disadvantages? Support your answer. What if this wayof life existed today?</UL><BR>Read the background information that follows before beginning this activity.<P>Background Information: <B>History of Agriculture in Saskatchewan</B><P>During the 1870s the plains Indian peoples realized that the buffaloherds were dwindling and other game would soon be depleted. Whenthe federal government offered reserve lands in treaties and promisedto create reserve farms with livestock, technology and educationalsupport, many Indian bands accepted. In order to encourage Indianbands toward successful agricultural operations, amendments weremade to the Indian Act. One amendment forbade participating inthe Sun Dance because it took the Indian peoples away from agriculturalactivities at what the government considered to be a crucial time.<BR><P>The government, however, soon realized that implementing theiragricultural treaty provisions and promises would be much moreexpensive than allowing the Indian peoples to continue to dependupon hunting and trapping on reserve lands. According to JohnTobias, the government did not begin to implement the reserveand farming provisions of the treaty in more than a token wayuntil 1879. And, not all promised farm animals and equipment weredistributed at that time. By this time Indian peoples were facingstarvation, with their early attempts at farming having littleeffect on the hunger crisis in their lives.<BR><P>Indian peoples protested and requested that the government providethe reserves with the promised support. They wanted skills, toolsand training in areas such as farming, carpentering and blacksmithingin order to help their reserves become self -sufficient.<BR><P>Agricultural activities on the reserve were restrained by theIndian Act. For example, from 1885 until 1935 Indian Agents andcommissioners used a permit and pass system to restrict the movementsof Indian peoples off the reserves. This system often determinedwhich crops and livestock could be grown and how production couldbe marketed.<BR><P>Other areas of control existed that limited the development ofIndian reserve agriculture. Band, and even individual, privatefunds were restricted. This hampered the purchase of items suchas new agricultural equipment. As a result, the original reservecommunal farms broke up and crop production fell dramatically.<BR><P>Sources:<P>Barron, Laurie F. (1988).
