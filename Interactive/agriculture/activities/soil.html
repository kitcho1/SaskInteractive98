Try some or try all of the tasks. These are ideas that are taken from the  Agriculture Saskatchewan series by Saskatchewan Education.</TD></TABLE><P><B>Activity 1: Soil Texture</B><P> Recognizing soil texture and its related characteristics isvery important in production decisions made by producers everyyear. Obtain dry samples of sand, silt and clay. Record yourfindings in a journal writing format.<BR><P>Using the samples of sand, silt and clay, rub a pinch of eachbetween the thumb and forefinger? Which is the smoothest? thecoarsest?<BR><P>Place a pinch of one of the samples in the palm of one hand andadd two drops of water from an eyedropper. Use the forefingerof the other hand to mix the water with the soil. Describe howthe sample feels when wet. Repeat with the other two samples.<BR><P>Place no more than three to five grains of salt in the palm ofone hand. Using an eyedropper, add five drops of liquid laundrystarch. Use the forefinger of the other hand to mix the salt andliquid starch. Add three drops of white glue and mix. Comparethis mixture to the mixtures produced in part B. Add two moregrains of salt and mix. Describe the effect of adding more salt.<BR><P>The last part of this experiment illustratesinteresting changes in texture.<P>Conduct a sedimentation test on a soil sampleto determine the percentage of sand, silt and clay in the sample.Calgon laundry powder is used to keep the individual soil particlesseparate. Use the following activity sheet for this part.<P><B>Activity Sheet - Sedimentation Test</B><P>You will need the following items.<BR><UL><LI>soil sample<LI>one litre fruit jar with lid <LI>Calgon (about 6 tablespoons) mixed in a litre of water <LI>ruler<LI>measuring cup<LI>tablespoon</UL><P><P>You want to determine:<BR><P>You do the following.<BR><UL><LI>Put 250 millilitres of soil in the jar and add 750 millilitresof water mixed with 5 tablespoons of the Calgon solution.<LI>Cover the jar and shake it for 5 minutes. Allow the materialto settle for 24 hours.<LI>After 24 hours measure and record the depth of the settledsoil.<LI>Shake the jar for 5 minutes again. Let stand for 40 secondsto allow the sand to settle. Measure the depth of the settledsoil and record it as sand depth.<LI>Let the soil settle for 30 more minutes. Measure the depthof settled soil. Subtract the sand depth and you have measuredthe depth of silt.<LI>The remaining particles are clay. What is the depth of theclay?<LI>Calculate the percentage of each soil separate. % separate= depth of separate x 100 total soil depth<LI>Express your findings in chart or graph form.</UL><P><P><B>Activity 2: Soil Observation</B><P>Collect soil from different areas.<BR><UL><LI>the playground<LI>a flowerbed at home<LI>potting soil bought at a greenhouse or supermarket<LI>a forested area</UL><P><P>Examine the samples using microscopes and/ormagnifying glasses and record your observations about the following.<BR><UL><LI>living organisms in the soil<LI>soil colour <LI>soil texture<LI>soil odour <LI>acidic, alkaline and neutral properties of soil<LI>other observations such as assumptions of soil fertility accordingto texture and colour</UL><P><P>If possible, arrange to exchange soil samples with a school inanother area of the province. See the following Activity Sheet.<BR><P><B>Activity Sheet - Soil Observation</B><P>Working in your group, obtain soil samples from various places.Place these samples in jars and carefully label them.<BR><P>Place the same number of paper towels on your work space as youhave samples. Label the towels to correspond with your samples.<BR><P>Examine each sample for the following.<BR><UL><LI>living organisms<LI>soil colour<LI>soil texture<LI>assumptions of soil fertility according to colour and texture<LI>soil odour<LI>acidic, alkaline or neutral characteristics (pH level)<LI>other items</UL><P>Devise charts  to record your observations.<P>Using a magnifying glass, or a microscope, examine each soil sample.Can you see any living organisms in your sample? If so, describethem.<BR><P>Describe the colour of each soil sample. Dark brown, dark greyand black soils are generally more fertile than lighter colouredsoils. Rate the fertility of the samples in order (1 being highestin fertility).<BR><P>Place about a tablespoon of soil from one sample in your hand.Add enough water to make the soil into a ball with the consistencyof putty. Note the texture of the soil.<BR><UL><LI>coarse, gritty: sandy soil<LI>sticky, slippery: clayey soil<LI>smooth: silty soil</UL><P><P>Try to break the ball of soil by squeezing it. If it breaks aparteasily, the soil is probably sandy. If it changes shape but basicallyremains a ball, it is probably loam, sandy loam or silty loam.<BR><P>Try to make a snake or ribbon from the ball. If you cannot doit, the soil is probably very sandy. If a short snake or ribboncan be made before it breaks, the soil is a mixture of sand, clayand silt. If a longer snake or ribbon can be made, the soil isprobably clayey.<BR><P>Evaluate each sample, determine the texture and record your findings.<BR><P>Does the sample have an odour? Describe it.<BR><P>Use pH paper to determine the acidity of each soil sample by placinga tiny sample of moist soil on the pH paper. Use distilled waterto moisten the soil, if necessary. A pH of 7.0 is considered neutral.More than 7.0 indicates alkaline soil. Less than 7.0 indicatesacidic soil. Most productive soil ranges from a pH of 6.0 to apH of 7.5.<BR><P>Other observations:<BR><P>e.g. To determine if there is organic material in the soil, placea few spoonfuls of each sample in a jar half full of distilledwater. Place the lid on the jar and shake it well. Let it sitfor about 15 minutes. Examine the sample for floating organicmaterial.<BR><P><B>Activity 3: Soil Zones</B><P>Why does soildiffer from region to region in Saskatchewan? For example, whyare there clay soils in the Regina-Moose Jaw-Weyburn area and fromKindersley southeast through Eston to the South Saskatchewan Riverand sandy soils around Good Spirit Lake and north of Maple Creek?Individually research this question usingthe sources available to you (e.g. magazine articles, encyclopedias,people, pamphlets). Share your ideas with others.<BR><P><B>Activity 4: Organic Matter</B><P>Q: How canpeople increase the organic material and nutrients in soils? <BR>A: Add fertilizers; make a compost pile. <BR>Try it! Build a compost pile, or at least researchhow a compost pile may be constructed. Create a step by step descriptionand include it in a newsletter to parents.Include information aboutpossible questions like....<BR><P>Why compost? (In order to add humus to the soil to replace organicmatter lost during harvest.) <P>How does composting work? (Organic matter is decomposed by microorganisms.)<P>What is used? (Use kitchen leftovers such as egg shells and vegetablematter, grass clippings or dead plant matter.)<P>What is needed? (A special bin or pit and organic material isneeded.)<P>How is a compost pile constructed? (Add a 20 cm layer of organicwaste; add a soil layer 5 cm thick; another layer of organic waste;soil; and so on. Keep the pile moist and turn it occasionally.)<P>What is happening? (Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungidigest the wastes and heat the compost to about 65&#176;C. Heatkills weed seeds and harmful organisms and speeds up the creationof humus. This process produces fertilizer rich in nutrients.<BR><P>So...what is happening out there now???<BR>Some industries and sewage treatment plants now return sludge(organic waste produced by the industry or treatment plant) tothe soil by using trucks to spread or spray the sludge on fieldsbefore planting or on pastures. Some agricultural producers arerecycling animal wastes in a similar manner. Find out more....<P>Set up an ant farm to see how living organismschange soil structure and redistribute organic matter. How elsedo animals do this?-tracks, holes, digging.<BR><P>Earthworms are another example of how living organisms changethe soil structure. Although earthworms are not common in manyfarming situations, their activity in the soil is fascinating.Try constructinga worm ranch. See the following Activity Sheet.<BR><P><B>Activity Sheet - Worm Ranch</B><P>A worm ranch vivarium can serve several purposes in the classroom.<BR><P>  <UL><LI>To show the interaction of living things and their environment  <LI>To study food chains and food webs  <LI>To show the importance of soil, light and water<LI>To study the effects of soil organisms on soil <LI>Enjoyment</UL><P>You will need the following items.<BR> <UL><LI>2 worm ranch vivariums (or ant farms)  <LI>topsoil mix, organic litter, sand, clay, aquarium gravel  <LI>wilted grass clippings   <LI>20 to 40 live earthworms</UL><P><B>To build an earthworm vivarium:<BR></B><P>  <UL><LI>Use 2 pieces of glass held 3 to 4 centimetres apart by a frame.Each side must have opaque covers in place when observation isnot occurring because light-sensitive earthworms will not tunnelnear uncovered glass.   <LI>Fill the space between the pieces of glass with layers of 'soil'.The depth of the layers is not critical, but should be similar.<LI>  Put each vivarium over an empty pan.<LI>  Add measured amounts of water to the top of each vivarium untilit begins to drain from the bottom of the frame. Record the amountsof water added.<LI>  Measure the amount of water that drains into the pan. What doesthe difference in amount indicate about moisture-holding capacityof soil?<LI>  Stock the ranches and observe the activity of the earthworms.<LI>  Cover the glass sides.</UL><P>Observations can be made over the next week at a set time. Ifthe opaque covers are constantlybeing removed from the glass, the earthworms will not move aroundvery much.<P>You could record your observations in a journal format.You could also diagram what thevivariums look like when  viewed at the beginning, halfway through and at the end ofthe experiment (e.g. layers of soil, tunnels).<BR>Consider:<BR> <UL><LI>Why was there a difference in how much water was added to eachvivarium before it began to drain out the bottom? a differencein how much drained through?<LI>  Are there differences in the activity of the earthworms in thetwo ranches?<LI>  What could have caused these differences?<LI>  What happens when the opaque cover is removed and why?<LI>  How do earthworms affect their environment?</UL><BR><P>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT/COLUMN END ########## -->	</TD></TR><!-- ##### WHITEPAGE END ##### --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop"  			ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 			ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">		<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" ALT="Return to AGRICULTURE" 		WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="20" vspace="4" BORDER="0" NAME="TopImg"></A>	</TR></TD>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF = "./modern.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "./method.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
