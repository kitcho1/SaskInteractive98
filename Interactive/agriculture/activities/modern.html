These are ideas that are taken from the  Agriculture Saskatchewan series by Saskatchewan Education.</TD></TABLE><P><B>Activity 1</B><P> Divide the class into small groups. Each group is responsiblefor developing a topic related to agriculture for presentationto the class. Some suggested topics follow.<BR><P>Note that some of these topics are very broad and may be subdivided if necessary. Try to use presentation formats other thanprint. For example, graphs could be used to show the global effectsof Saskatchewan agriculture or posters to describe &quot;agricultureis food production&quot;. You could even design a web page advertising your beekeeping or exotic animal operation!<P>Suggested topics:<UL><LI>Saskatchewan soil, an important agricultural resource<LI>environmental issues in an agricultural operation<LI>global effects of Saskatchewan agriculture<LI>global effects on Saskatchewan agriculture health and safetyissues<LI>specific agricultural operations such as beekeeping or fishfarming and their places in the agricultural industry<LI>agriculture is food production<LI>changing technology in agriculture<LI>women's role in agriculture</UL>  <P><B>Activity 2</B><P>Feeding the World: Read the information below, then complete the section that follows.<BR>The total surface area of the planet is about 45 billion hectares,of which 13 billion hectares is land. About 4.68 billion hectaresof this land area is agricultural land and only 1.4 billion hectaresis suited to intensive cultivation. Most of the agricultural landis pasture land not suitable for growing crops.<BR><P>From the 1950s to the year 2000 the world cropland is expectedto increase from 1.4 billion hectares to 1.6 billion hectares.World population is growing so quickly that, although there hasbeen an increase in the amount of food produced, there is actuallyonly half the productive land per person that there was 35 yearsago.<BR><P>There are over 5.2 billion people on this planet. By 2000 it isestimated there will be 6 billion people in the world. If thepopulation continues to grow at this rate, by 2050 there willbe 11 billion people in the world. Annual world food productiontoday is 4 billion tonnes. But, 20% of the world population ishungry every day. Production and distribution of food is not equitable.<P>There are two types of hunger, or food insecurity: undernutritionand malnutrition. Undernutrition is not getting enough food suchas in times of famine. Malnutrition is eating poor quality foodthat is not balanced in its nutritional content. Both undernutritionand malnutrition have far reaching effects on the population, especiallyon women of childbearing age and children.<BR><P>According to the World Food Secretariat, chronic undernutrition,or a continuing lack of food, is the most widespread. This couldbe seasonal in nature. There may be an abundance of food at harvesttime but not enough food, or money to purchase it, the rest ofthe year. Although undernutrition due to famine receives morepublicity, chronic undernutrition affects many more people indeveloping countries such as Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan,Sri Lanka, Ethopia, Nigeria, Zaire, Uganda and Mozambique.<BR><P>Choose a recorder and a reporter within your group.<P>After each person in your group has read the information, havea group brainstorming session.<BR><UL><LI>List as many 'plus' statements as you can that result fromthe above information. All statements are valid.<LI>List as many 'minus' statements as you can that result fromthe above information. All statements are valid.<LI>List as many interesting questions as you can that resultfrom the above information.<LI>Discuss where you can find answers to your questions.</UL><P><B>Activity 3</B><P>Work in small groups of three or four tobrainstorm changes to the agrifood industry that have been madebecause of consumer demand. Have one member of each group reportback to the large group and record the suggestions. Possible suggestionsfollow.<BR><P>Pork producers may raise some pigs for the pork chop market, othersfor the bacon market and others for the ham market. Beef is now20% leaner than it was 15 years ago. New varieties of saskatoonberries have been developed that are larger and can be grown domestically.. There is an increase in organic farming and the wild rice andaquaculture industries. There is an increase in crop diversification.Producers are growing field peas, potatoes, native berries, mushroomsand honey. Smaller meat carcasses and cuts of meat are requiredbecause of changes in family size and attitudes about diet.<BR><P>Think about what meals were like, what theyare like today and what a meal may be like in the future.<BR><UL><LI>Why have changes occurred?<LI>What forces ensure that changes will continue to occur?<LI>Are these changes positive or negative?<LI>Which people and organizations would agree with your opinionand which would disagree?<LI>What will the effects be on the agriculture industry?</UL><P><B>Activity 4</B><P>Investigate the lesser known areas of theagricultural industry such as apiculture, game ranching, organicfarming, aquaculture, berry harvesting and wild rice production.Information about these industries can be obtained from SaskatchewanAgriculture and Food, 3085 Albert Street, Regina, Saskatchewan,S4S OB1 or from the association representing that industry.<BR><P><B>Activity 5</B> <P>Record everything you eat in a day. Complete several concept webs using the foods eaten asthe end concept. This will require reading of labels, classifyinginto food groups, researching the origin of the food and discoveringabout food additives and food enrichment during processing.<BR>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT/COLUMN END ########## -->	</TD></TR><!-- ##### WHITEPAGE END ##### --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop"  			ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 			ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">		<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" ALT="Return to AGRICULTURE" 		WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="20" vspace="4" BORDER="0" NAME="TopImg"></A>	</TR></TD>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF = "./history.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "./food.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
