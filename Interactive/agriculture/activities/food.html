Use the bread outline as a guide).<P> If you are in a class, divide intogroups of three or four. Each group should test several brands ofone type of bread (e.g. white, whole wheat, rye). If possible,include a loaf of homebaked bread. Devise guidelines for testing a variety of characteristics inthe bread such as:<BR> <UL><LI>outward appearance, <LI>volume, <LI>interior quality, <LI>tastequality, <LI>other items you may wish to test or evaluate such ascost, packaging or advertising. </UL><P>Develop data sheets to record the test results...or use the data sheet provided as a guideline. <P>Rank the loaves of bread and summarize the information on a largesheet of paper for class viewing.<BR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Sample Bread Quality Score Sheets<BR></FONT><P><B>Test for Outward Appearance<BR></B><TABLE border=2 bgcolor="#ggaabb"><TR><TD WIDTH=89><B>Loaf Number</B></TD><TD WIDTH=89><B>Shape</B></TD><TD WIDTH=89><B>Colour</B></TD><TD WIDTH=89><B>Character of Crust</B></TD><TD WIDTH=89><B>Total</B></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=89>&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH=89>&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH=89>&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH=89>&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH=89>&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE><P><I>Perfect score: 10 points in each area of testing<BR></I><P><B>Standards:<BR></B><P>Shape:<BR><UL><LI>Count in 5 slices from each end of the loaf.

Each group should imagineit is a producer who has developed a new agricultural product.Two examples of these are <B>broccoflower</B> and <B>applepear</B>. You may want to think of a new product on your own. Each groupshould be responsible for the following:<BR><P>Describe the item by naming it and producing a representationof it on paper or through a three-dimensional representation (a model).<P> Decide how the product would be used by consumers and how itwould be processed so that it could be used. <UL><LI>Describe the packaging. <LI>Describe the market for the product (who, where) and the transportationplans. <LI>Formulate a marketing plan. <LI>Determine how many people in the class would try it.</UL><P>One last thing you may wish to try...to produce the item. For example, you may decide that you will market the new product "Peanut/Cheese Chews". Make some for everyone to sample!<P><B>Activity 3: The Changing AgriFood Industry </B><P>Work in small groups of three or four tobrainstorm changes to the agrifood industry that have been madebecause of consumer demand. One member of each group should reportback to the large group and record the suggestions. Possible suggestionsfollow.<BR><P><UL><LI>Pork producers may raise some pigs for the pork chop market, othersfor the bacon market and others for the ham market. <LI>Beef is now20% leaner than it was 15 years ago. <LI>New varieties of saskatoonberries have been developed that are larger and can be grown domestically.<LI>There is an increase in organic farming and the wild rice andaquaculture industries. <LI>There is an increase in crop diversification.Producers are growing field peas, potatoes, native berries, mushroomsand honey. <LI>Smaller meat carcasses and cuts of meat are requiredbecause of changes in family size and attitudes about diet.</UL><P>Think about what meals were like, what theyare like today and what a meal may be like in the future. Then consider the following questions...<BR><UL><LI>Why have changes occurred?<LI>What forces ensure that changes will continue to occur?<LI>Are these changes positive or negative?<LI>Which people and organizations would agree with your opinionand which would disagree?<LI>What will the effects be on the agriculture industry?</UL><P><B>Activity 4: The Cost of Food</B><P>Work individually to compute the differencein price between a loaf of bread and the pile of flour that isneeded to make it. This activity connects the value added conceptto actual money value. Estimate the amount ofmoney you think the producer would receive from the price ofa loaf of bread. Then, compute the actual value usingcurrent prices. These are average figures within the last ten years in Saskatchewan.<BR><OL><LI>1 bu. wheat makes about 19.5 kg flour (43 lb.)<LI>1 bu. wheat weighs approximately 27 kg (60 lb.) <LI>0.45 kg (16 oz.) flour makes 1.57 0.45 kg (16 oz.) loaves of bread<LI>The average price of a loaf of bread is $1.09. <LI>In January, 1991 the price of 1 bu. of No. 1 Canadian WesternRed Spring Wheat with 13.5% protein content was $3.18 at Saskatoon,Saskatchewan. <LI>How many loaves of bread can be made from 1 bu. of wheat? (1 bu.wheat makes approximately 68 loaves of 0.45 kg loaves of bread)<LI>What is the money value of the wheat in one loaf of bread? (approximately4.7 cents)</OL><P>A similar activity can be done using a litre of milk. The farmer's share varies with the price of wheat.<BR><P><B>Activity 5: The Value Added Concept</B><P>In order to illustrate the concept of <I>value added, </I>in front of a group (your class), placeabout 350 grams of wheat on a table  beside an unwrapped, 450gram loaf of bread. It takes about 350 grams of wheat to makeone loaf of bread. Offer to sell each item to the highest bidder.Probably, the bread will invoke more interest than the pile ofwheat. Consider the following questions:<BR><UL><LI>Why will you give me more money for the bread than for thewheat? <LI>If this loaf of bread contains this amount of wheat, whatis the difference? <LI>Why does society (your class) value the bread more thanthe wheat? (Use the term <I>value added.)</I>. <LI>What has been added to the bread to make it more valuable?<LI>If the bread were not available, what would happen? <LI>If this loaf of bread were sliced and wrapped, what wouldhappen to the price? Why?<LI>What happens to the price if organically grown wheat is used?</UL><P><P>Brainstorm a list of items that have <I>value added </I>and areworth more to society than the original products used to createthem (e.g. blue jeans pizza, recorded cassette tapes). Determinewhich items are agriculture related.<BR><P>The concept of <I>value added </I>can be further investigatedby tracing a particular product and its costback to the original product and its cost. Potato chips are anexcellent example. Think of the cost of a bag ofpotato chips (from $.75 to over $2.00; depending on the size of the bag -- and type). Estimate the cost of the originalproduct and then  trace the processing back to the originalpotato. How many times has the price of the potato been increased?There are many facts that you may discover.<BR>  <P><UL><LI>Special potatoes high in starch and low in sugar are neededto make potato chips. <LI>Nutrients are lost because the potato is exposed to lightand air during processing. <LI>Water jets and caustic soda are used to remove the skins ofthe potatoes. <LI>Vegetable oil is used to fry the potatoes after they are thinlysliced. <LI>The potato slices increase their weight by 30 times, during fryingby absorbing oil. <LI>Artificial additives such as colour enhancers and artificialflavours are added to the chips. <LI>The packaging for potato chips is often made from plasticsthat are nonbiodegradable.</UL><P><B>Activity 6: You are what you eat....</B><P>Record everything you eat in a day. Complete several concept webs using the foods you ate asthe end concept. This will require reading of labels, classifyinginto food groups, researching the origin of the food and discoveringabout food additives and food enrichment during processing. <P> How much of the food that you consumed was NOT chemicals? How long do the chemicals used in processing that remain in the food, stay in your body? What do people who have chemical sensitivities buy their food? At what cost? <P><B>Activity 7: Using Beef Cattle - All of Them</B><P>All parts of beef cattle are useful for some purpose. Overone hundred pharmaceuticals that humans use today come from beef. Make use of a resource centre to find out about the following:<BR><OL><LI>insulin, <LI>corticotropin, <LI>heparin, <LI>thrombin, <LI>epinephrine, <LI>parathyroidhormone, <LI>rennet, <LI>thyrotropin (TSH).</OL><P> Some of the facts youmay discover follow.<BR><P>Insulin<UL><LI>from the pancreas<LI>used by diabetics<LI>pancreas of 26 animals needed to supply one diabetic withenough insulin for one year<LI>majority bioengineered today</UL><P>Corticotropin<UL><LI>from the pituitary gland<LI>used to treat allergies, anemia, respiratory diseases, leukemia</UL><P>Heparin<UL><LI>from the lungs<LI>used to prevent blood coagulation during operations and totreat frostbite and burns</UL><P>Thrombin<UL><LI>from the blood<LI>used to promote blood coagulation</UL><P>Epinephrine<UL><LI>from the adrenal glands<LI>used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever, asthma and otherforms of mild allergies<LI>majority used today synthetic (norepinephrine)</UL><P>Parathyroid hormone<UL><LI>from the thyroid<LI>used to treat thyroid deficiency</UL><P>Rennet<UL><LI>from the stomach<LI>used to help infants digest milk<LI>thyrotropin (TSH)<LI>from the thyroid<LI>used to stimulate the thyroid gland</UL><P>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- ########## CONTENT/COLUMN END ########## -->	</TD></TR><!-- ##### WHITEPAGE END ##### --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop"  			ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 			ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">		<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" ALT="Return to AGRICULTURE" 		WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="20" vspace="4" BORDER="0" NAME="TopImg"></A>	</TR></TD>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF = "./modern.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF = "./soil.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
