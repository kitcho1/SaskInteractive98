It varies with the crop being fed upon, the plant'sgrowth stage, the growth stage of the larvae and the number oflarvae present.<P>Small larvae feeding from the underside of the leaveschew irregularly shaped holes in the leaves but they usually causelittle damage even when population levels are high. Crop damageaccelerates rapidly once the larvae moult to the second last stage.These larvae are about 13 mm (0.5 inches) in length. Larvae inthe last two larval stages eat about 80 to 90% of the plantmaterial consumed.<P>If the plants, especially canola, drop their leavesbefore the larvae are mature, the developing larvae will feeddirectly upon the seed pods. Seed pods may be &quot;debarked&quot;.More commonly, the larvae chew holes into the seed pods and eatthe seeds. At high population levels, the entire seed pod may beconsumed. Even when the seed pods are only stripped of their outergreen layer, this may contribute to crop losses through prematureshattering.<P>In flax, the larvae eat flowers and the developing<B>bolls</B>. But once the flax bolls are full size and start to ripen,larval feeding is usually limited to the calyx below the boll.Occasionally, larvae will feed on the green stems of ripeningbowls causing them to drop off.<P>Significantly crop damage usually occurs within athree week period between late July to late August depending onthe season and where the crop is grown.</TD></TR><TR>	<TD><B>Pupa</B></TD>	<TD><A HREF="../../../media/stills/agriculture/crops/bertha_army_worm/baw11.jpg" TARGET="bigwindow"><img src="../../../media/stills/agriculture/crops/bertha_army_worm/t_baw11.jpg" WIDTH=120 Height=90></A></TD>	<TD><B>Pupa Stage - Bertha Armyworm</B><P><UL><LI>A pupais a pod&#173;like structure the bertha armyworm forms arounditself to protect it while it transforms from the larval stageto the adult moth.<LI>Bertha armyworms survive the winteras pupae in the ground at depths of 5to 16 cm (2 to 6 in.)<LI>Pupation usually begins in mid tolate August.

Bertha armyworm outbreaks appear to be favouredby snow accumulation which protects pupae from experiencing prolongedexposure to temperatures below &#173;10&#176;C.<P>The trend towardreduced tillage and stubble conservation will likely result inmore snow accumulation on infested fields and favour bertha armywormsurvival, especially in years with early snow fall.<P>In addition, newly hatched larvae are especiallyvulnerable to inclement weather and diseases.<P><OL><LI><B>Monitoring</B> - It is important to monitor larvae numbersin each field. Adjacent fields may have very different larvaldensities, depending upon how attractive the crop was when themoths were laying their eggs. Adjacent crops may also have different sized larvae, depending on when the eggs were laid.<P>For accurate larval estimates in a crop,samples are taken that are in at least three locations a minimum of 50 metres apart. The plants are beaten  to dislodge the larvae. The plants are then pushed aside and a count is taken of the number of larvae in the square metre area. As few as 20 larvae per square meter can reduce canola yields by 1.16 bushels/acre. <P> Adult populations can be monitored using traps whichattract the male moths with pheromones or synthetic sex attractant.Changes in the number of moths collected by these traps correspondto the fluctuations in bertha armyworm larval populations. Thehigher the trap catches the more likely larval populations willexceed economic thresholds. <P><P><LI><B>Biological Control</B> - Thereare a number of diseases and parasites attack the bertha armywormincluding: a nuclear polyhedrosis virus, an ichneumonidwasp, and a tachinid fly. These natural enemies often do not destroy larvae until after considerable damage has occurred. These biological agents have their greatest impact on reducing the number of armyworm produced a year or two after the peak of an outbreak and are probably the reason that severe infestations only last 2 or 3 years. Their presence in a crop does not however, indicate that control measures are not warranted.<P><LI><B>Cultural Control</B> - Manipulationof bertha armyworm populations by tillage, planting alternativecrops, altering seeding dates, seeding different cultivars, effectiveweed control, early swathing, and fall cultivation are methodsthat may be used to reduce crop loss.<P>Fall cultivation has been suggested as a way to killbertha armyworm pupae. Fall cultivation minimizes the amount ofsnow trapped on a field and exposes pupae to sub&#173;zero temperatures.Although this practice may be effective for individual fields,fall cultivation is not likely to be effective unless it is adoptedby air producers since adult moths are strong flyers.<P>Altering seeding dates may help to reduce berthaarmyworm infestations. Also, Polish and Argentine type canolaseeded on the same dates are likely to infested at different levels.<P>Bertha armyworm infestations in flax, peas, lentilsand sugar beets can be reduced with adequate weed control. Controllinglamb's quarters and wild mustard early  prevents infestationbecause larvae first feed upon the weeds and then move onto crops after the weeds have been destroyed.<P>Early swathing can be used to limit damage when thecrop is very close to mature and weather conditions are warm anddry. The technique has merit if the crop is within a couple ofdays of normal swathing and the bertha armyworm population doesnot greatly exceed the economic threshold. However, problems mayoccur if larval populations are underestimated or the canola cropis swathed too early. High larval densities may result in seriousdamage to swaths because larvae will continue to feed either untilthey are mature or the crop dries to the point&#173;where it isno longer acceptable as food. Once canola is swathed the optionof controlling the population with insecticides is no longer possibleand extensive damage may occur. Swathing the crop too early mayalso increase the number of green, unripened seeds and adverselyaffect seed quality and grade.<P>Although cultural control practices have merit, mosthave not been thoroughly investigated. The precise effect of usinga particular cultural control strategy is unknown and may varyfrom year to year. The best option is to select a combinationof crops, varieties, and seeding dates that will minimize therisk of crop loss.<P><LI><B>Chemical control</B> - Chemicalcontrol is the producers last line-of-defence againstthe bertha armyworm. For the best results, an insecticide shouldbe applied as soon as economic thresholds are reached and beforethe larvae have damaged the plants. If producers are to get themost value from an insecticide application it must be used inconjunction with an adequate monitoring program. Early detectionof bertha armyworm larvae is critical if crop losses are to beminimized.<P>An insecticide application is recommended when bertha armyworm larvaeare abundant enough that they may consume crop valued in excessof the cost of controlling them. This is referred to as <B>economic threshold</B>. The economic threshold for bertha armyworm varieswith the cost of the insecticide, the method of application, andthe crop's value.  <P>Control is usually achieved with a single, well&#173;timedapplication of any of the registered insecticides applied withaerial or high clearance ground equipment.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="./blackleg.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="../alternative/index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
