This family includes broccoli, cabbage and mustard seed. Canola grows 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.5m high and has a seed pod with 15&nbsp;to&nbsp;40 small roundseeds. The seeds have a high percentage of oil and therefore canola is classed as a type of oilseed. <P>There are two types of canola;the short growing season Polish type (<b>Brassica rapa/campestris</B>) and the longer season Argentine type (<b>Brassica napus</B>). The Polishtype is the predominant kind grown in Saskatchewan.   <P><p><B>Where is it produced in Saskatchewan?</B><P>Canola can be grown in various locations in the province depending on soil fertility and weather conditions. The day to maturity range from 85 to 87 for the Polish varieties and 98 to 102 days for the Argentine varieties. While the Argentine varieties take longer to mature, they typically produce a higher yield. <P><B>How much do we produce?</B><P>Canola is fifth in the world trade in agricultural crops, after rice, wheat, maize and cotton.  Canola is Canada's third most important grain export, after wheat and barley.<P>In the 1940s, Canadian farmers planted 6000 acres of rapeseed per year.  In the 1990s, farmers are planting about 10.5 million acres of canola annually. About 20% of Saskatchewan field crops are canola. Saskatchewan produces approximately 40% of the Canadian production of canola. <P>Canola oil accounts for 63% of the total edible vegetable oils produced in Canada, compare to 24% for soybean oil and 4% for sunflower oil.<P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_canprod.jpg" ALT="Canola Products" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="160" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/canprod.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><B>What does it look like when Iuse it?</B><P>Canola is pressed and the oil is used for cooking and salad oils or processed into margarine. Canolais 42 to 45% oil, and 23% protein. It contains monosaturated fat (62%) and polyunsaturatedfat (32%).  These fats are essential sources of energy, and may actually lower the risk of heart disease.<P>Canola oil has the lowest level of saturated fats of the available vegetable oils at 6-7%.

Fields are cultivated, seeded, fertilized and pesticides are applied to control insects, weedsand diseases. Seedlings emerge 4-10 days after planting. The bottom leaves are produced in a rosette and the plant sends up a flower stalkwhen the days lengthen. Flowering lasts 14-21 days. The fields at this time are a brilliant mass of yellow blossoms. The flowers of the Polish type are fertilized by the wind and the Argentinetype are self-pollinated. However, bees visit the flowers for nectar to produce honey and also carry pollen. <P>Once the flowers are fertilized,pods form and take 35-45 days to fill. The field is swathed when about one-third to one-half of the seeds have turned colour from green to yellow or brown. The swathed crop is allowed to dry forabout 10 days and then combined.<P><A HREF="../../food/foodind/canolaind.html"><B>What happens after it leaves the farm?</B></A><P></tr></td><P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG align=left WIDTH=200 height=150 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/crops/t_elevator07.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/crops/elevator07.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Part of the Saskatchewan canola production is moved by truck to the nearest grain elevator and is unloaded. From there, the canola seed is transported to crushing plants in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and Saskatchewan, where it is processed.  Canola oil is quite literally "wrung" out of the seed.  After initial crushing, a crude oil remains.  When that is cleaned and refined, the oil can be stored safely for months or years.  Canola seed yields about 40% oil and 60% meal.<P>  A typical processing plant has a daily crushing capacity of 6.5 thousand tonnes.  The crushing plant at Nipawin, Saskatchewan, has an annual capacity of 104,000 tonnes.<p>Canola oil is shipped, in bulk, from the processing plant to domestic and foreign markets, or packaged at the plant for distribution to consumers. Japan is the number one export market for canola and canola seed. Otherimporters of smaller quantities are the United States, Western Europe, Belgium, Korea and Mexico.<P>Canada is a net exporter of vegetable oils, with the U.S.A. importing more than 80% of our production.

To reduce the impactof these, farmers are advised to grow canola only one year in four on the same field. Seed treatment is used to reduce seedling disease and early flea beetle attack. Herbicides are used to controlcompetition from weeds.<P>The economics of growing canola versus grain are at present such that farmers are shortening rotations and increasing the risk of disease. Plant breeders are working to produce varieties which have tolerance to the major diseases.<P><B>Interesting FACTS...Canola and Rapeseed</B><P><UL><LI>Canola and rapeseed are actuallythe same species.  Rapeseed was good for industrial uses; it was used as a lamp and cooking oil by ancient civilizations in Asia and Europe, and was found to be the best lubricant to cling to steam washed surfaces on steam engines.  Original varietiesof rapeseed had high levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates, making cooking oils unsuitable for humans (erucic acid is associatedwith heart lesions in test animals) and the oilcake (seed residue) was unsuitable for livestock (sulfur compounds reduced ability tobe used as a glucosinolate). Breeding experiments led to the development of rapeseed varieties which contained lower amounts of these compounds.<P>The improved varieties were given the name of canola, and released in 1974.  The crop rapidly became very popular; for the firsttime, the dollar value of canola was thought to exceed wheat in 1994.<P><LI>Plant developers are working with both rapeseed and canola to establish new varieties to widen therange of non&#173;food or industrial uses. Some of the latter could include the production of lubricating or hydraulic oils, diesel fuel additives, plastics and even medicines.<P><LI>Days to maturity of different canola types can range from about 85 to 87 (for Polish varieties) and98 to 102 (for Argentine varieties). Although both types are prone to a serious disease called <A HREF="blackleg.html" TARGET="bigwindow">blackleg</A>, the Argentines can experience severe losses owing to their longer growing times. Weather conditions,seed varieties and market conditions have all had strong influenceson the areas and ranges seeded to this crop.</UL><P>Check out the <A HREF="http://www.canola-council.org/" TARGET="bigwindow">Canola Council of Canada</A> for more information.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="./index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="./flax.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
