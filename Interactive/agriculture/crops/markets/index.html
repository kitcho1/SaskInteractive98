When prices are high,sellers are willing to provide larger quantities of their productsto the market than when prices are low.<P><B>Demand </B>isthe quantity of a product or service buyers are willing to purchasefrom the market at a given price. When prices are low, buyersare willing to purchase greater quantities of a product than whenprices are high. There is a direct relationship between productsupply and product demand.<P><B>Economic factors</B> areinfluences such as changes in supply and demand, inflation ordeflation, technological advances, tariffs and world situationsthat affect the price received by the producer or user of theagricultural commodity.<P><B>Domestic market </B>refersto markets within Canada. This market may include processing companies,the Canadian food industry and individual producers.<P><B>International market </B> refersto the customers outside of Canada who purchase Canadian products.<P><B>General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade </B>(GATT) is the agreementestablished shortly after World War II that provides guidelinesfor trading accessibility to all countries. Today, over 100 countriesare involved in GATT.<P><B>Canada United States Trade Agreement</B> (CUSTA)is the bilateral freer trade policy established in 1989 betweenCanada and the United States.<P><B><A HREF="whtbrd.html">Canadian Wheat Board </A></B>isa government agency established to market western Canadian wheatand barley for export or for human consumption in Canada. It mayalso sell feed grains for animal consumption in Canada.<br>[<A HREF="whtbrd.html">More on Wheat Board</A>]<P><B>Open market </B>isthe market used by producers for any grain marketing transactionsnot handled by the Canadian Wheat Board. It is used by producersof rye, flaxseed, canola and other specialty crops. Producerssell their crops directly to the local grain elevators or primaryelevators for a price determined by larger grain companies usingthe market quotations from grain trading facilities such as theWinnipeg Commodity Exchange.<br>[<A HREF="openmrkt.html">More on Open Market</A>]<P><B>Winnipeg Commodity Exchange </B>facilitatesthe buying and selling of grain. It does not handle grain noris it directly engaged in the purchase or sale of a commodity.It provides a cash and a futures market for each commodity traded.The futures market provides the opportunity for buyers and sellersof grain to negotiate what the crops will be valued at in futuremonths by considering world supply and demand factors.<br>[<A HREF="wpgcmex.html">More on Winnipeg Commodity Exchange</A>]<P><B>Input or production costs </B>arecosts incurred by the farmer or rancher in growing or raisingproduce. They refer to expenses such as cost of seed, fuel, fertilizerand chemicals, replacement of machinery and pasture fees.<P>Marketing agricultural products consistsof two sectors: marketing primary production and marketing processedproducts. Successful marketing in both areas depends directlyon consumer demands.<P>Farmers and ranchers market the productsthey produce through a variety of means. They can sell to theconsumer directly, through government agencies or on the openmarket. Processed products are generally marketed through retailstores or food service industries.<P><B>The Value of the Canadian Dollar</B><P>Every day, during discussions ofissues in agriculture and in other areas, the value of the Canadiandollar is referred to on the news or in newspapers and magazinearticles. The value of the Canadian dollar fluctuates daily andis influenced by interest rates, politics and the rate of inflation.Because Canada's largest trading partner is the United States,our dollar is often compared to the dollar of that country.<P>The kind and value of moneyvaries according to the country using it. For example, the peso,lire, franc and English pound all have different valueswhen compared to the money of another country. That value is usuallycompared to the value of the money of the largest trading countriesof the world and is determined by international economists andmoney traders.<P>Anything produced in Canada, whetherit is an agricultural product or a manufactured item, is producedfor sale. Many of these products are exported to the internationalmarket. This is like selling the product in a huge internationalgrocery store. When our dollar is lower in value than the dollarof the country purchasing our products, the purchasing countrycan buy more products for fewer dollars.<P>When it is reported that the valueof the Canadian dollar has dropped in relation to the United Statesdollar, it is often assumedthat this occurrence is not good for Canada. This is not alwaysthe case. If the value of the Canadian dollar decreasesin relation to the United States dollar, countries will be ableto purchase larger amounts of Canadian agricultural commodities.<P><B>Grain and Oilseed Marketing</B><P>Grain and oilseeds are sold to marketsaround the world and in Canada through the Canadian Wheat Boardor on the open market, depending on the type of crop being marketed.Prairie grown wheat and barley must be marketed through the CanadianWheat Board if they are being sold for export or human consumptionin Canada. They may also be marketed through the Wheat Board ifthey are being sold in Canada for livestock feed. All other cropsgrown in Saskatchewan are sold on the open market.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="../management/elevator.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="./whtbrd.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
