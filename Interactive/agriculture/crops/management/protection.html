High-yield agriculture really means being able to grow more bushels of grain from the same, or even less, amount of land. High-yield agriculture has fed many, many more people in the world -- and on the same agricultural land that has been farmed for centuries.<P>Crop yields have been increased due to a number of factors. New approaches to crop production and technological advances contribute to the success of farming today. Included here are: new types and varieties of crops, different farming practices, improved and new equipment and the use of synthetic fertilizers and crop protection products. The development and use of synthetic and natural pesticides (<B>crop protection products</B>) is one of the most important parts of high-yield agriculture. <P><B>Crop Protection Products and Their Use</B><P><B>Pesticides</B> are used to control insects, diseases, weeds, fungi and other pests in crops, food, fruit, vegetables, animals and buildings. Fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides, sanitizers and soil fumigants are specific kinds of pesticides. <P>Pesticides may be <B>natural</B>, or <B>synthetic</B>. Natural pesticides are produced by plants and animals themselves, while synthetic chemicals began to be manufactured in the 1950's. Most synthetic and all natural pesticides are <B>organic</B>, meaning they contain the carbon molecule. <B>Inorganic</B> pesticides do not contain carbon.<P>Synthetic chemicals used on crops have been developed over many years and tested to ensure safety of their use. Without the products, farmers around the world would have to break new land at a significant cost to natural resources and wildlife habitats. Even now, pests destroy approximately 35% of the world's crops and food supply. Whether natural or synthetic, if used properly, pesticides are a safe way to produce high-yield agriculture (natural pesticides occur in plants and animals and are just as potent, if not more, than synthetic chemicals). <P>The use of these pesticides depends upon the farming practice. While the practice of a monoculture (growing a single crop) has increased food supplies it also has encouraged many pest populations to grow out of control. Sometimes, intensive pesticide use has been necessary to save crops from destruction. In the process, many natural predators and beneficial insects have been destroyed at the same time as the pests and many genetically-resistant pest species have developed. Since the 1980's, farmers concerned about the over-reliance on chemicals have turned to <B>Integrated Pest Management</B>.  These practices include a combination of crop rotation, tillage, the use of crop protection products and monitoring of insect infestation levels to determine if action is needed, the use of insect predators and the development of pest and disease resistant crops.<P>Integrated Pest Management also involves many agronomic practices that make crops more competitive against weeds and other pests.<P>These practices include<UL><LI>using different methods of seeding<LI>using clean seed<LI>the use of more winter annuals, whichget off to a faster start in the spring (to suppress weeds) andcan also be harvested earlier (before weeds scatter seeds)<LI>cultivation and mowing to control weeds along field borders<LI>enhancing soil fertility<LI>and the spacing of crop rows.</UL><P>The goal of Integrated Pest Management is to decrease the amount and use of crop protection products as much as possible. When crop protection products are used, herbicides may be applied to plants directly by <B>post-emergent</B> spraying, or by <B>pre-emergent</B> applications which are incorporated into soils. Certain herbicides (containing the ingredient glyphosate)are <B>non-selective</B> and kill all plant groups, but the chemicalbreaks down quickly so that it will not be present to damage thenext crop. An application of one herbicide at one time may not controlall the weeds for an entire year. Weed seeds can germinate atdifferent times and some weeds may be resistant to a particular herbicide. <P>Pests such as plant <A HREF="protection.html#disease">diseases</A> and <A HREF="protection.html#insect">insects</A> are common threats to field crop production. Pesticides and natural controls are used to limit crop damage. Other pest organisms include nematodes (round worms),worms, mites, pocket gophers and certain birds. Unlike weeds, whichpose a consistent threat from year to year, the other kinds ofpests are usually sensitive to weather and their own natural controls,which include diseases and parasites. Therefore, their numbersand potential damaging effects are not as easy to predict andnot as easy to monitor. Departments of agriculture carry out surveysand make forecasts of potential trouble areas.<P><B><A NAME="disease">Disease</A></B><P>Crop diseases may be carried from plant to plant or remainin soil, straw, seeds, buildings or implements (seeders) to infectnew crops. Bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause damage by feedingon (breaking down) cells in seeds or vegetative parts of plantssuch as roots, stems and leaves. These parasitic actions can kill plant parts, reducing the overall plant performance, or theycan kill the entire plant. <P>Control or prevention involves a combination of the cultural and chemical methods.<P><UL><LI>The use of seedswhich are not carrying any disease&#173;causing organisms eitherinside or on their surfaces is the best defense against the spread of disease. Certified seed from commercial seedgrowers reduces this possibility. Other types of seeds may be chemically treated using systemic fungicides (enter the seeds and kill any possible diseases carried internally); protective fungicides (remain on the seed surfaces); dual purpose treatment (combination of a fungicide and an insecticide). Canola, for example, can have a coating to guard against fungi and against insects like flea beetles.<P><LI>Rotation of crops is important since minimum and zero tillage increases the chance of disease because of the practice of leaving straw on the surface, rather than burning or turning it under. Proper crop rotation allows a reasonable time interval before growing the same type of crop on a field.<P><LI>The use of plant varieties or typeswhich are resistant to plant diseases decreases the chance of disease destroying a crop.<P><LI>Another technique used to decrease the threat of disease is to use caution when working different fields with the same equipment. Disease may  be transferred from field to field, through movements of straw or machinery. Cleaning machinery of straw, seeds and other matter before moving reduces such possibilities.</UL><P><B><A NAME="insect">Insects</A></B><P>Insect control is similar to that of other pest controls.  Crop rotations can stop the life cycle of certain insects. For example, some wheat varieties are resistant to the wheat stemsawfly; canola, legumes and barley can be used where the wheatmidge is troublesome. Visualinspections of fields and surrounding borders helps to determine if there is an infestation.  Some seed varieties may be coated with insecticides prior to seeding. Contact poisons (for insects with suckingmouth parts) or stomach poisons (for chewing insects) may be used for affected plants. Most insecticides are non-selective and are harmful to all organisms, including humans.<P>Biological controls are also used to help control pests (by using a another living organism). All microorganisms, plants and animals have natural enemies. These can include parasites, predators and diseases. By using such natural enemies,  other species are not usually harmed. For example, ladybird beetles whichcontrol aphids and other insects, a parasitic wasp whichattacks the wheat midge and the seedhead weevilwhich destroys the seed-producing ability of scentless chamomile are natural, biological controls.<P>Detailed informationabout specific insects, their life cycles and control measuresis available from the rural service centres.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="./seeding.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="./harvest.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
