It is also used to unload grain from its elevatorbins into railway cars and trucks. These tall, often brightlypainted wooden or concrete towers may be seen along railway sidingsin many towns and villages across the Prairies and within easyreach of grain farms. Saskatchewan now has about 2,300 grain elevators.It once had over 6,000!<P>In the early days of the grain trade in eastern Canada and the United States, grain was stored and transported in bags. When the Canadian prairies were opened for agriculture, this systemwas still in use: farmers delivered their grain in bags to warehouses located along the railroads. The same bags were shipped by railand boat to final markets. At every step of the way, the bagshad to be loaded and unloaded by hand.<P>Transportation companies soon discovered bulk grain handling wasmore efficient. The railroads offered free sites and other privilegesto companies or individuals who would build bulk handling facilities,called elevators.<P>The first elevators on the prairies usually had capacities of650 to 800 tonnes.<P>Elevators were named for the way they work. An endless verticalconveyor-belt with buckets (called a <b>leg</B>) elevates the grain from an unloading area at the bottom to a distributionsystem at the top. From here, the grain is redirected, using gravity, to any one of several storage bins, or into a railway car.<P>Early elevators were built 11 to 16 kilometres apart;areasonable distance for horse-draw wagons to haul grain from nearbyfarms.<P><b>The Modern Elevator</B><P>The country elevator has changed since the early days of the CanadianWest, but the changes tended to be in size, speed and efficiency,rather than in function or importance to the community.<P>Elevators still exist for one purpose; to collect prairiegrain for shipment to Canadian and international markets. Theyoften become the economic heart of a small prairie community.<P>About 70 per cent of the grain grownin Saskatchewan is spring wheat. After the wheat is harvested,it is brought to a grain elevator to be sold. The manager of theelevator weighs and <B>grades </B>the wheat and then stores it.The farmer may not sell all his wheat to the company that ownsthe elevator. Some may be kept for seed for the next year or forfeeding livestock.<P>In the past decade, the prairie grain-handling system has beenaffected by changing economic times and technology. Older elevatorshave worn out. Meanwhile, better roads and highways, and largertrucks have made it unnecessary for new elevators to be so closetogether. Many of the original prairie rail lines have been abandoned.<P>A growing number of <b>high-throughput</b> elevators nowdot the prairies. These elevators can receive large quantitiesof grain from farmers, and ship it out again by rail very quickly.The newest of these high-throughput elevators can store up to37&nbsp;000 tonnes. They are more than 37 times the size of the elevatorswhich first appeared on the prairies, and are equipped to handlegrain many times faster than the originals.<P>Many elevators can now weigh and unload even the largest semi-trailertrucks; up to 31 metres long and weighing as much as l00 tonnes when loaded.<P><B>Major Working Elements of a Country Elevator</B><P><OL><LI>Driveway and receiving area<LI>Elevating leg<LI>Telescoping head<LI>Distributor<LI>Overhead shipping scale<LI>Boxcar surge bin<LI>Hopper car surge bin<LI>Boxcar loading spout<LI>Hopper car loading spout<LI>Storage bin<LI>Boot tank<LI>Cleaner bin<LI>Grain cleaner<LI>Dust control unit</OL><P><b>High-Throughput Elevators</B><P><OL><LI>Office<LI>Driveway and receiving area<LI>Boot tank<LI>Elevating leg<LI>Leg head<LI>Distributor<LI>Overhead shipping scale<LI>Dust control unit<LI>Storage bin<LI>Hopper car surge bin<LI>Hopper car loading spout<LI>Shipping room<LI>Loading platform<LI>Hopper car</OL><P>In each high-throughput elevator, two high-capacity elevating legs can receive as much as 340 tonnes per hour each. In addition,grain can be loaded to rail cars up to 1&nbsp;120 tonnes per hour;without interrupting the receiving, cleaning or burying operations.<P>Today, most elevators are highly automated. Operators direct grainmovement within the structures from control panels linked to acentral computer. This results in fast and efficient accountingfor the operation.<P>Many of the new high-throughput elevators offer the additionalservice of condominium or producer owned leased storage. Thesestorage facilities are jointly built by the Pool and local producers.Local producers can invest in storage space connected directlyto the elevator. Space is usually sold in 4,000 units. Under theterms of the purchase, producers can deliver grain against theirspace and the Pool is responsible for managing the facility andmaintaining the condition of the grain until the producer notifiesthe Pool of his intention to sell the grain. This new serviceprovides many benefits to the producer, including flexible grainstorage, increased delivery opportunities; particularlyat harvest time, reduced storage risk, increased marketing flexibility,convenience and the potential for return on investment throughappreciation in value of the unit over time.<P><B>A Load Comes to the Elevator</b><P>When the farmer pulls the truck into the drive shed of the elevator,the elevator operators weigh the truck. As the grain is dumped,the operators take samples of grain and test them to determinethe quality, and how much of the load is weed seeds or other materials.New innovations, like Mobiload, allow the farmer to test grainright on his own land. Buying can occur direct from the farm.<P>After the operators know what grade of grain the farmer is delivering,they can direct it to one of the bins.Samples are tested to check its quality, appearance, and proteincontent. The wheat is then dumped into a delivery pit. A seriesof buckets on a conveyor belt lift or 'elevate' the grain fromthe pit to the top of the elevator. From there, it goes througha <B>spout </B>to one of the storage bins. The bins keep separatethe different grades of wheat.<P>Once the truck is emptied, the operators weigh it again to determinethe weight of the farmer's load.<P>When the wheat is ready to be shippedout, it is sent into a loading bin called a hopper. From the hopper,the grain goes through a grain cleaner and into the cleaner bin.From there, it is sent to the top of the elevator through a specialspout. The spout leads to a boxcar or hopper car beside the elevator.<P>The wheat is shipped out by train tomany different ports; the Pacific ports of Vancouver or PrinceRupert, the Hudson Bay port of Churchill, or to the Great Lakesport of Thunder Bay. At the destination port the grain is unloadedand cleaned, then dried and stored in huge terminal elevators.Terminal elevators store the grain until it can be loaded intoships and sent to market inother parts of Canada, the United States or to distant ports.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="./storage.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="../markets/index.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
