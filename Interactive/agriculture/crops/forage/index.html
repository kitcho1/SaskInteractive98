Forage crops can be baled and stored - providing winter feed for livestock, when grazing is not possible. Forage crops provide year-round stands that offer protection to the land from the effects of the environment; wind and watererosion and in some cases, soil salinity. Rotations that include forage can help upset pest cycles (disease, insect and weeds) and the deep root systems help hold the soil together. Organic matter of the soil may be built-up by planting otherwise 'dormant' land. Legume or pulse forages help to increase the N-content of the soil by fixing nitrogen. Forage crops are easier to grow than some cereals and oilseeds, store better and can be used to feed livestock thus turning a fairly decent profit for the farmer who plants forage crops. <P><B>Where is forage produced?</B><P><IMG align=left WIDTH=150 height=220 vspace=5 hspace=10 SRC="../../../media/drawings/agriculture/t_sksoilzones.jpg"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/drawings/agriculture/sksoilzones.jpg','bigwindow',	'toolbar=no, location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Forage may be grown throughout Saskatchewan and may be grown on sections of land that are not suited to other crops.

cereals can also be usedfor hay or pasture. Cereal silages are higher in protein than corn silage but usually lower than good quality alfalfa haylage.  Energy values are lower than corn silage and often comparable to alfalfa haylage. Oats are preferred over barley for pasturing and hay due to their higher palatability.<LI>Mixed grain and spring wheat <LI>Winter Cereals (Rye, Triticale, Wheat) - provide fall and earlyspring grazing.  Adequate nitrogen fertility in the spring willprovide good stored feed yields by late May. Like spring cereals,feed quality decreases as the crop matures.<LI>Oats and Peas - field peas seeded in mixture with oats will increase forage yields and enhance feed quality.  Pea mixtures have increased protein levels and improved feed digestibility.<LI>Sorghum-Sudan Grass, Sudan Grass - members of the sorghum family can be used for silage, green chopor pasture.  </UL><P> <B>How are forages produced?</B><P> Forages are either perennial or annual plants. Perennials may take longer to establish, but are typically long-lived -- from 4 to 30 years. Annual forages are seeded each year and some of these types are utilized in crop rotations. In order that the producer has success in growing forages, proper plant management is important. Several publications are available that outline the importance of rangeland management. Overgrazing of pasture can become a serious problem and lead to soil degradation, waterway contamination and loss of profit for the producer. Understanding the growth of forages is important for their management.<P><B>Growth of Forages</B><P>Most vascular flowering plants contain organs (stem, root, leaf, flower) and <B>meristematic tissue</B>. It is at the meristematic tissue that growth of the plant occurs. This tissue can be found at the tip of the stem, ends of roots or tips of side branches, depending upon the type of plant. The plant grows by the division of the cells in the meristematic area. Larger plants such as trees have meristematic tissue in the trunk of the tree, allowing for growth in width as well.<P><B>Apical meristems</B> give rise to specific above-ground structures (like leaves, stems and flowers) as well as below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes). In grasses, growth occurs above-ground at the tip of the stem. When this portion is grazed or cut off, growth of the plant stops. New growth comes from structures called <B>axillary buds</B>, found in the crown or in the lower portion of the plant. In legume plants, if apical meristems are grazed off, growth comes from dormant meristematic tissue located in the <B>axils</B> of leaves or in the crown. This may take a long time and the plants may not recover in a growing season. Thus, forages may be grazed or mowed, as long as meristematic tissue remains to produce new growth for the plant.<P>Nutritional value of forages depends not only upon environmental conditions, but the stage of growth of the plant. More carbohydrates are stored in the plant in the stage of growth when buds form than in the seed-forming stage and after the plant has been cut (or grazed), carbohydrate levels drop as new leaves are formed. This information is important to the producer who rotates grazing pastures to ensure plants have the chance to recover and continue to grow into the next season.<P> <b>Storage of Forage</B><P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/t_lv_roundbales.jpg" ALT="Round Bales" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/farm/lv_roundbales.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>Baling of sun-cured hay is still the most common method ofpreserving forage crops. Large round bales have replaced smallsquare bales in most haying operations.<p><B> Silage</B> is increasinglypopular with beef cattle producers, and has been a mainstay of thedairy industry for many years. Silage uses forage of highermoisture content and preserves it through fermentation. The major advantage of silage is that the crop can be harvested when it is ready in almost all weather conditions. Few nutrients are lost.<p> Severalprocessing plants <B>dehydrate alfalfa</B> and form it intopellets or cubes. Densified hay bales are made by compactingregular small square bales into compact bales for efficienttransport. <P></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### --><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### --><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A></td><td></td>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="../alternative/inoculate.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="./grassleg.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A><!-- # # # # # # # # # #BOTTOM NAV END # # # # # # # # # # --></td></tr></td></tr></table><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
