It is thought that the original interest in them may have been for entertainment through cock-fighting, only later to be recognized as a source for meat and eggs. Archaeological records from India indicate domestication approximately 2000-3000 B.C. From India, domestic fowl then spread throughout Europe and Asia. It is not known if they were introduced to South America by Pacific Islanders, or later through the Europeans. Chickens are now the most common domestic animal, estimated at 5 billion animals worldwide.<P>Chickens are natural scavengers, making them suitable animals for backyards production, scavenging and eating kitchen wastes. This type of farming is important in many countries, but has been overtaken in North America by intensive farming practices. As North America moved into intensive, highly mechanized grain farming, the availability of high quality concentrate feeds allowed large scale intensive poultry operations to be built.<p>There are few distinct breeds of chickens remaining in commercial poultry production. Although distinct breeds do still exist, they are not used in large scale operations.  Today, poultry are classified as either <B>meat producing</B> or <B>egg producing</B> varieties. The genetic distinctions are a result of complex breeding programs used by primary breeding companies.<p><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/t_whiteleghorn.jpg" ALT="leghorn" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="134" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/whiteleghorn.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>1. <B>Egg Producing Chickens (layers)</B><p>The <B>leghorn</B> is the most popular basis for egg laying varieties of chickens.  This variety originally came from Italy.  Most varieties today are developed in England, Denmark, or America. The leghorn was first brought to America in the 1840's.  There are two varieties; the <B>single comb</B>, and the <B>rose combed</B> leghorn.  Mature male leghorns weigh between 2.3 and 2.7 kilograms while females weigh between 1.8 and 2 kilograms.  The leghorn is usually white in colour and is used as the basis for 75% of all egg laying stock in Canada.<p> Egg producing chickens have been bredfor maximum egg production rather than meat yield, and can produceup to 300 eggs per year.<P>2. <B>Meat Producing Chickens (broilers, roasters)</B><p> Dual purpose chickens are often raisedin small flocks for both meat and egg production. While layers are usually light-bodied chickens, meat producing varieties are heavily muscled and noted for rapid and efficient growth. As with egg laying varieties, the genetic lines of meat producing chickens are carefully controlled by primary breeding companies.  These birds are commonly based on a crossbreed involving the Cornish breed.  Mature male birds can weigh between 2.6 and 6.4 kilograms,  however, they are commonly slaughtered before they reach maturity. By 6 weeks of age, they can reach weights averaging 2 kilograms, and by 8 weeks of age they can exceed 3.6 kilograms.<P>   Thehens will produce 200-250 eggs per year.  Available breeds includeRhode Island Red crossed with Barred Rock, Columbian Rock, orLight Sussex.  These hens usually produce brown eggs.</UL><hr></tr></td><P><P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/t_turkey01.jpg" ALT="turkey" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/turkey01.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><h3>Turkeys</h3>	<br>	<embed src="../../../media/audio/agric/turkey.aif" width="33" height="16" 	autostart="false" controls="playbutton"><p>The turkey is the only mainstream agricultural animal domesticated in the Americas. The wild turkey was originally found widely distributed in North and Central America. American Indians domesticated the bird for food and feather production (the cliff-dwelling Anasizi peoples of the southwest US wove the feathers into blankets). The domestic turkey was then transported to Europe by the Spaniards.<P>Selection pressures have created a bird that is much different than it's wild ancestors. Domestic turkeys have been selected for a rapid, efficient growth rate, with a high proportion of breast meat. This has led to a larger, more docile domestic bird with a greatly reduced flying ability. Selection for large breast muscles to increase the amount of white meat has created birds that are only 30% successful at natural matings (all domestic turkeys are now bred by artificial selection). Selection for white feathers allows the plucked, dressed bird to have a cleaner appearance in supermarkets.<P>Types of turkey poults which may beavailable for purchase include white turkeys (of various growthrates) and bronze turkeys. White turkeys are available in variousstrains which will reach different sizes.  Some will reach a sizeof 4 to 6 kg (9-13 lb) at younger ages (10 to 12 weeks).  Otherswill grow to a higher meat yield, 8 to 16 kg (17-35 lb) at laterages (14 to 20 weeks).  Poults can be obtained with males andfemales grouped together or separate. Bronze turkey poults are generallysold as mixed sexes.  They do not grow as rapidly as the commercialwhite birds, and are usually a bit smaller at maturity.<hr><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/t_geese_pilgram.jpg" ALT="geese" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/geese_pilgram.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><h3>Ducks and Geese</h3><p>Ducks make up a small proportion of commercial poultry operations within Saskatchewan. Raised mainly in small operations, three main breeds are dominant. Many breeding programs and preservation programs have been established for maintaining wildlife populations, but ducks are still raised for meat and feathers on farms. Breeds are commonly chosen because they are flightless and have a highly valued carcass of substantial size.<br>The <B>Pekin</B> is a white coloured bird weighing 3.5 - 4.1 kilograms.<br>The <B>Rouen</B> is multicoloured similar to a mallard weighing 2.7 kilograms. Their plumage similar to wild mallardducks.<br>The <B>Muscovy</B> is a slower growing breed with males weighing 4.5 - 5.5 kilograms and females weighing 2.5 - 3 kilograms. Their meat is not as oily as other types of ducks.<p>Geese are also raised for meat andfeathers (down).  Emden geese are white at maturity and will weighapproximately 6 to 9 kg (15-20 lb).  Other breeds may also beavailable in Saskatchewan.<p>Ducks and geese can be raised indoors,with or without access to an outside run, or they can be raisedprimarily outdoors.  Ducklings and goslings can be turned outinto an outside run or pasture by about 3 or 4 weeks of age. They may be raised indoors, and feed and water should be placed onopposite sides of the pen in order to stimulate exercise.<P>Ducks and geese can tolerate temperaturesdown to freezing, and can be raised outside later into the fallthan chickens and turkeys.  They require shelterfrom the wind and precipitation in the winter and sun during the summer.<P>  Ducks and geese are bothered by fewer diseases and parasites than chickens or turkeys; proper management helps to decrease the chance of contracting diseases. Waterfowl require feed in the form of pellets or crumbles (less wastage). Geese are better foragers than ducks,but both can utilize the nutrients in succulent green plants. They should also have daily access to a regular duck or goosediet.  This may be a complete diet or a supplement mixed withgrain.<p><hr><P><h3>Ostrich and Emu</h3><p>The emu and ostrich are members of the Ratite family. These are the two largest species of poultry. The ostrich is the larger of the species, standing 2.3 metres tall and weighing 130 - 200 kilograms when mature.  The ostrich has only two toes, unlike most birds which have four toes. Although the ostrich and emu are unable to fly because their thin feathers permit air to flow through them instead of pushing it away, these birds are extremely fast and can run up to 65 km/h. These birds can live for up to 70 years and may breed for as many as 20 years. They lay eggs which are 15 - 20 centimetres in length and can weigh up to 1.4 kilograms. Although the ostrich and emu are raised for meat, feathers and skin, they are currently highly priced and sold for breeding stock in Canada.</TD></TR></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="../horses/horse_breeds.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="../sheep/sheep_breeds.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
