While many of the eggs produced on farms are unfertilized, only those eggs which are fertilized will hatch. Fertilized eggs can be purchased from breeding operations, or by the successful mating of a rooster and a hen by natural methods or by using artificial insemination. Turkey production relies on the use of artificial insemination to produce fertile eggs. The continuous genetic selection for turkeys with large breast muscling has resulting in many breeds which are no longer capable of copulating because of their large and awkward size.<p>Fertile eggs are first incubated in a machine called a <B>setter</B>. This is a large insulated box containing many shelves which can be tilted back and forth. The tilting of the shelves permits the mechanical rotation of the fertilized egg to prevent the embryo from becoming attached to the egg shell. The embryo should remain in the center of the egg. If it becomes attached to the egg shell, it may fail to develop properly. The setter is heated to permit rapid development of the embryo and are maintained at a high humidity to prevent the egg from becoming dehydrated. The incubation time varies depending on the species of bird. Chickens are incubated for 21 days, while turkeys, ducks and geese  will take 26-28 days before hatching.<p>Eggs are moved to the hatcher near the end of their incubation period. The hatcher is similar to the setter in that it is a warm and humid environment. The hatcher contains drawers in which the eggs will hatch. When it is time for the egg to hatch, the chick uses its <B>egg tooth</B>, a sharp horn on its beak to break through the egg shell. Chicks will remain in the hatcher for 12 - 24 hours during which their down will dry. <P>After the chicks are removed from the hatcher, they receive a vaccination and are sorted based on their sex. They are then shipped in cardboard or plastic boxes to the commercial farms.<p><B>Housing</B><p>Large barns are built to house thousands of birds. Meat producing birds are raised on straw bedding, while laying hens are housed in groups of 2 - 4 birds in rows of cages.  There have been many complaints about the lack of space for egg laying birds to exercise and move while housed in cages. Egg laying birds could be housed on floors with litter similar to meat producing birds if a nesting area is provided. However, this program is less popular with producers in North America because it results in a larger number of damaged and dirty eggs. Birds housed in cages are also less likely to peck and kill other birds. The cage system is still currently used in Saskatchewan because it is still the most economical program and provides a better quality of life when compared to alternative housing programs. Ducks, geese and turkeys are commonly raised indoors in Saskatchewan. They can however be raised outdoors on pasture during the warmer months, yet they must be protected from predators.<p>Poultry barns must be disinfected between production cycles to reduce the transmission of disease from one cycle to the next. Many operations will even restrict people from entering the barn if they have been in contact with other birds to prevent the introduction of new strains of disease. Birds having been vaccinated at the hatchery will seldom require medication unless there is a serious disease challenge.<p>Because of the large number of birds housed in confinement, barns must be well ventilated to maintain temperature and to prevent the accumulation of toxic gases released from manure. Poor ventilation will allow gases such as ammonia to accumulate to levels which can causes skin and lung damage making the barn an unpleasant place for birds and people. Fans are placed along the outside walls to remove contaminated air from the building. Fresh air is drawn into the barn and should be evenly distributed by a system of ducts.<p><B>Brooding and Rearing</B><p>When day old chicks first arrive on the commercial farm they are small in size and are very delicate. They can survive for 24 hours without feed because of the nutrients provided by the yolk which they absorbed prior to hatching. Their small size means they have little body reserves to live for long without feed and water. They may also become chilled very quickly if heat is not provided. Heat lamps and fresh feed and water should be provided immediately to reduce death loss. As birds mature, they will require more feed, and will be better able to provide their own body heat.<p>Feeders and waterers should be adjusted to the birds height to permit access, but not be too low that birds can contaminate feed and water with feces. Careful guidelines are normally provided by the breeding company outlining proper room temperatures, lighting programs, and dietary requirements depending on the birds stage of development.<p><B>Lighting</B><p>Light intensity and photoperiod length are carefully controlled in commercial poultry production. Low light levels are commonly used to discourage cannibalism. When birds first arrive, they should be placed in a brightly lit room to allow them to find feed and water easily. After a brief time, the light intensity should be reduced. The length of light per day is important for the rate of growth and development. Long simulated day lengths will encourage birds to eat more and they will develop at very rapid rates. Photoperiod length is usually limited to slow growth during early development to avoid bone deformities and weak legs. Meat producing birds may be exposed to long photoperiod lengths as they reach the end of their producing cycle to encourage rapid weight gains.<p> <B>Nutrition</B><p>Feeds are specially formulated for the type of bird and the production program. For meat producing birds, three classes of rations are used; <B>starter</B>, <B>grower</B> and <B>finisher</B>. The feed chosen will depend on the birds age and the stage of production. Each diet is carefully formulated to meet the requirements for protein, energy, minerals and vitamins which are required for optimal growth and performance.<p>The size and texture of the feed is also important to encourage eating. There are three commonly used feed types including mash, pellets and crumbles. A mash diet is made from grains which are finely ground and mixed with other ingredients including synthetic amino acids, minerals and vitamins. Because of the fine texture of mash diets, birds may eat slower and may take longer to raise when compared to other types of feeds. A pelleted diet is a mashed diet which has be compressed to form small pellets which are easily swallowed and quicker to eat. Pelleted diets are easily consumed by mature birds, but may be too large for younger birds. A crumble diet is made from a pelleted diet which has been broken into smaller pieces. They are usually used for young birds because they are easier to eat than large pellets.<p>Egg-laying birds are usually feed similar textured diets as meat producing birds. Requirements for protein, energy, vitamins and minerals (especially calcium) may be different depending on the age and productivity of the bird. Calcium levels in egg producing birds may be higher because this mineral is used in high quantities for the production of the egg shell.<P> During the first week of brooding, deaths due to dehydrationcan be reduced by having extra water available in the brooderring.  This can be accomplished by using several shallow trayssuch as ice cube trays placed throughout the ring.  It is alsohelpful to dip the chicks' beaks into the water when initiallyplacing into the brooder ring.<P> Fresh water should be available constantly, and troughs cleanedroutinely.  As with the feeders, trough height should be regularlyadjusted to be even with the back of the birds.<P><H3><A NAME="turkey">Turkey Management</A></H3><P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/t_turkey21.jpg" ALT="turkey" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="229" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/turkey21.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P>Turkey poults require greater care than chicks, especially within the first few weeks of life. If they are eating and drinking properly, deaths due to starvation and dehydration may be reduced. The greatest period of risk is the first 5 days.  The use of brooder rings is important for broodingpoults, as it helps contain them near heat, feed and water sources. Turkeys also like to eat litter, whichcan lead to gizzard impaction, the birds will lose weight and die.  Providing a source of insolublegrit for the poults in the first 2 to 3 weeks will assist the gizzard in breaking down theingested litter.<P>As with broiler chickens, turkeys areusually raised on litter floors or in outdoor runs.  As the birdsget older, the height of feed and water containers should be raisedso that the lip of the containers are at the same height as theback of the birds. Turkeys may be raised on pasture, andthe range used should be rotated so that a different area is usedeach year.  This will help reduce the incidence of parasitic infection. It is also suggested that a maximum of 200 birds/acre be stocked. <P> Properventilation and regular cleaning of pens (including the additionof fresh litter) is important in the raising of turkey. The birds are susceptible to <I><B>breast blisters</B></I>  which are abscess-like sacsof fluid found on the breastbone and  <B><I>breast buttons</I></B> which are similar, but are solid tissue rather than fluid-filled.  Turkeys can developbreast blisters or buttons in conditions where the litter is wetor there are high concentrations of ammonia in the air.  will aid in preventing breast blisters/buttons.<P> It is important to note that turkeyshave different nutrient requirements than chickens.  Poults shouldtherefore be fed diets meant for turkeys, not chicks. Manyof the problems encountered with raising turkeys are related tohow fast they grow.  Turkeys can develop leg problems and metabolic diseases.    Since some diseases which may infect pigs(such as erysipelas and fowl cholera) can be transmitted to turkeys, farms that raise pigs should not raise turkeys. Maintaining good air quality in turkeybarns is essential for disease prevention.  Even low levels ofammonia can cause lung damage.  If ammonia is noticeable by smell,or causes eyes to tear up, lung damage can occur.  Damage to lungscan allow bacterial entry, which can then spread throughout thebirds' system.<P><tr><td colspan=4 valign=top><br><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/t_egglayers.jpg" ALT="Chickens" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/poultry/egglayers.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><H3><A NAME="eggs">Egg-laying Chicken Management</A></H3><P>Egg-laying hens will sit on perches if they areprovided and if perches are provided, henswill also be less likely to stay in the nests at night, thus helpingto keep the nests clean. The best type of perch is one that is made of a hardwood, for easier cleaning, and the perch should be a little over 30 cm wide at the top and deep enough for the bird to grasp, but not injure itself with its own claws.Each bird requires about 15 cm of perch.If hens are to be kept in straw-litter ()pens, or outside during the laying period, nest boxes with nesting material such as straw, should beprovided (30 cm x 30 cm). One nest box placed approximately 60 cm off of thefloor, should be provided for every5 hens.  They should be , with perches to help hens reach the entrance.  <P>The optimum temperature range during egg production is from 12-26&deg;Cis suitable for hens during egg production.  Temperatures outside of this range may cause a decrease in egg production; the temperature should never be allowed to go below freezing. Laying hens should always have readyaccess to feed as they will eat from 100 to 120 grams of feed eachday.  Feed consumption is affected by temperature, age of bird,and water availability (should be constantly accessible). The egg shell is composed of calcium; birds must have a regular intake of the mineral to ensure the egg shell is not too thin. As well,a deficiency in calcium can lead to skeletal problemsand reduced egg production.  The main calciumsource for laying hens is limestone and/or oystershell in thefeed.<P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/t_eggs.jpg" ALT="eggs" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="250" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/food/eggs.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P>Yolk color varies from pale yellow colour todark gold yolks.  Yolk colour is influenced by pigment contentin the feed.  If the hens have access to greenfeed,alfalfa or corn, the yolks will be darker.  Eggs are collected regularlyand nesting material is kept clean in order to avoid bacterial contamination. Eggs should be allowed to cool gradually prior to refrigerationto avoid sweating (which could also lead to contamination).  Eggsare normally stored for 3-4 days at temperatures of 10-13&deg;Cbefore marketing.  Albumen (egg white) quality will decrease asthe length of storage increases. Eggs may be cleaned by being brushed off with sand-paper or washed.  The water (low in iron), with a sanitizer added, should have a temperature at least 12&deg;Chigher than the eggs themselves.   Eggs should berinsed and then completely dried prior to storage.<P>A problem often encountered with smallerflocks is poor egg production or sudden drops in production. There are many possible causes for low egg production, and oftenit is a combination of a few different factors.  These factorsmay also influence egg size and shell quality.Possible causes of low egg production include:<BR><UL><LI>Feed which is poor in quality (low in protein, energy, and calcium, for example), withnutrient deficiencies and imbalances.  <LI>Lack of water <LI> Toxins contained in the feed.<LI>Improper lighting. <LI>Changes in temperature, especially those that are sudden.<LI> Poor ventilation (causing a build-upof gases).  <LI>High stockingdensities. <LI>The age of the birds. Commercial pullets begin laying eggsat 19-20 weeks of age, and peak production occurs around 24-26weeks.  The hens in smaller flocks may not start until later. Production begins to drop slowly after the peak and by 72 weeksof age is down to 70% of the hens laying in a given day.  Thehens will eventually cease to produce and go into a moult (loseand replace feathers).  Following moulting, hens will lay eggsfor at least a second year.  Egg production after a moult willbe approximately 10-15% lower than the first year.<LI>Various diseases such as infectious bronchitis, mycoplasmagallisepticum (MG)  and avian encephalomyelitis and parasite infectionssuch as coccidiosis and mites can also cause a reduction in production.</UL><P>One other disease that may affect egg-laying birds is <B><I>cage-layer fatigue</I></B> or osteoporosis. Since calcium is put into each eggshell that forms, the calcium requirements for caged birds is fairly significant. The calcium that goes into the eggshell comes from the hen's bones. Cage-layer disease may be caused by a  nutrient deficiency(calcium, phosphorus, and/or vitamin D).  Poor skeletal development and lack of exercise (especiallyin cages) are also causative factors of the disease. Hens with this disease have losta significant amount of bone and will go out of production.  Othersigns of the disease include paralysis, fragile and deformed bones,fractures, and weak egg shells.  In extreme cases, hens will die. <P> Good nutrition during the rearing andpre-lay periods is essential for good skeletal development.  Properlevels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D are important duringthe laying period.  In small flocks it is common to supplementthe diets with a calcium source (oystershell, limestone) thatthe hens can obtain free-choice.</TD></TR></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="../horses/horse_management.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="../sheep/sheep_management.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
