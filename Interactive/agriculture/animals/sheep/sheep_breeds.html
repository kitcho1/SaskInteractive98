In Canada, the sheep industry has concentrated on producing a high quality carcass.  The majority of sheep breeds in Canada are referred to as <B>medium wool, mutton-type</B> sheep.

The original Suffolks were the result of crossing Southdownrams on Norfolk Hornedewes. Apparently the product of this cross was a great improvement overeither one of the parents.<P>Establishing itself as a good milker which contributes to the rapid development of the young lamb, these sheep lack hair on their face and legs and, instead, they have a fine black hair.  They have a deep, broad body with well-developed hind quarters. Mature Suffolk rams weigh from 250 to 350 pounds(113-159 kg), and ewe weights vary from 180 to 250 pounds (81-113 kg). This breed is raised primarily for meat, and is not good for wool because of their lightweight fleece which may contain black fibers. Fleece weights from mature ewe are between five and eight pounds (2.25-3.6kg) with a yield of 50 to 62 percent.<P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/t_sh_hampshire.jpg" ALT="hampshire" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/sh_hampshire.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><P><B>Hampshire</B> (sire breed)<P>The Hampshire is another English sheep, developed in Hampshire county. The Hampshire-Downevolved from the mingling of different strains of kindred blood from sheepin co-existence along the borders of Hampshire County. Over the last century,   Hampshires have been bred in North America to exhibit desirable characteristics. Hampshire sheep have the genetic ability to efficiently convert forageinto meat and fiber and are adaptable and productive in various geographicregions. <P>This compact, blocky sheep has a large, open face with dark brown ears, eyes and face, and is an active sheep with a mild disposition. The ears are moderate in length, thick, covered with a coarse dark brown or black hair and free from wool. The Hampshire is a heavy eater (and has rapid growth) which produces good, meaty lamb carcasses and fleece that is fairly dense. Mature ewes will average a six to ten pound (2.7-4.5 kg) fleece. The lambs are born large and they grow fast. Mature rams should weigh 275 pounds or more and mature ewes should weigh200 pounds or more in breeding condition.

Dorsets are one of the oldest of the Downs breeds. They are a dual-purpose breed with a unique trait held by dorset ewes; the ability to breed anytime, allowing them to produce offspring twice in the same year.  This makes the breed ideal for producing Easter lamb. The ewes are good mothers, good milkers and multiple births are not uncommon.  <P>The dorsets are noted for their white face and heavy milk production. They are white-faced, medium sized and noted for its excellent ability to complement other breeds. They have good body length and muscle conformation to produce a desirablecarcass. Dorset ewes weigh from 150 to 200 pounds at maturity and rams weigh from 225 to 275 pounds at maturity. Dorsets have short wool that is very white, strong, close and free from dark fiber. The fleeces (ewes) average five to nine pounds (2.25-4 kg) in with a yield of between 50% and 70%. <P>The breed may be polled or horned. Polled Dorsets originated at North Carolina State College in the United States as the result of a mutation which occurred in thepurebred Horned Dorset flock at the college. After careful research andtesting were done to assure that the Polled Dorset carried the same characteristics as the Horned Dorsets and were able to propagate these traits, the new strain was registered in the 1950's.<P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/t_sh_rambouillet.jpg" ALT="rambouillet" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/sh_rambouillet.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P><P><B>Rambouillet</B> (ewe breed)<P>The history of the Rambouillet sheep  beganmore than two centuries ago. The Rambouillet breed originated with Spain'sfamed Merino flocks, which were known from the earliest times as producers of the world's finest wool. The Spanish government was so protective of their Merino flocks that any exportation was forbidden.This policy changed in 1786, however, when the King of Spain granteda request from the government of France and sent 359 carefully selectedrams and ewes to help improve the native French stock. The sheep were sentto the Rambouillet farm near Paris where, according to government records,they have been bred since 1801. Other flocks were bred in the same manner in Germany and the North American flocks are descendants of either one of these originating flocks.<P> The Rambouillet is a dual-purpose animal, commonly raised on range in western Canada.  They also adapt well to intensive management conditions. They are a large heavy boned animal, very strong and vigorous.  The rams (male) have large spiral shaped horns, while the ewes (females) are hornless. Mature Rambouilletrams weigh between 250 and 300 pounds (113-135 kg), ewes range from 150to 200 pounds (68-90 kg). This breed is known for its high quality, fine wool.

The newborn lambs have the ability to get-up, nurse and run just minutes after their birth. The ewes have strong protective instinct toward their lambs, have plenty of milk and take extremely good care of their lambs. A mature ewe will weigh 180 pounds and a mature ram 300 pounds.

Katahdin sheep are medium-sized andefficient, bred for utility and for production in a variety of managementsystems. Katahdins are docile so are easily handled. They are very adaptable to climatic conditions. For example, in cold weather, they grow a verythick winter coat, which then sheds during warm seasons. The shedding of this meat sheep contributes to its popularity as a low maintenance livestock breed. Their smoothhair coat and other adaptive characteristics allow them to tolerate heatand humidity well. Katahdins are also significantly tolerant of internaland external parasites and if managed carefully require only minimal parasitetreatment.<P><IMG SRC="../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/t_sh_kat_ewe2yr11dtwin.jpg" ALT="katadhin twins" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><FORM><INPUT TYPE="button" NAME="Button1" VALUE="hi-res image"	onClick="window.open	('../../../media/stills/agriculture/livestock/sheep/sh_kat_ewe2yr11dtwin.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br><P>They tend to gain slower than traditional breeds.
