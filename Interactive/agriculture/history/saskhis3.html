Each <B>township</B> is about six miles square and isdivided into thirty&#173;six sections. Each section contains 640acres. Correction lines occur periodically in order to allow forthe curvature of the Earth.<P>Because the Canadian survey system added the distances requiredfor road allowances within the township and the number of roadsin each township varies, townships are not exactly six squaremiles.<P>Settlement by non&#173;Aboriginal immigrants was slow prior to1886. People were not interested in moving west. The constructionof the railway through the southern prairies encouraged settlers,but did not significantly increase the speed with which settlementwas occurring.<P>The settlers that did come were required to develop agriculturaltechniques suitable to the operation of their new homesteads.The building of the railway allowed agricultural implements andsupplies to be shipped west.<P>The completion of the railway and the availability of cheap landresulted in a number of group settlements being built as farmingcommunities. Some of these were<P><UL><LI>Cannington Manor located 64 kilometressouth of Moosomin, <LI>the Temperance Colonization Society at Saskatoonand <LI>the Qu'Appelle Valley Farming Company at Qu'Appelle.</UL><P>Agriculture in Saskatchewan at this time usually consisted ofplanting and harvesting wheat crops. Some ranching occurred inthe area west of Moose Jaw where the Canadian Agricultural, Coaland Colonization Company was set up to raise cattle, horses, sheepand pigs. This ranch consisted of about 100,000 acres. The sizeof this operation was unusual. The majority of beginning rancheswere operated as family businesses on a much smaller scale.<P>Indian peoples were also involved in the growing agriculture industryof the West. There were many individual Indian farmers and someIndian bands that were highly successful at farming. Problemsarose when financial support and technical expertise promisedby the federal government in the treaty agreements did not materialize.Successful Indian agricultural operations were also underminedby the limitations of the Indian Act. One example of these limitationswas the permit system enforced from 1885 to 1935. A permit orpass from the Indian agent was required if an Indian wanted toleave the Indian reserve for any length of time and for any reason.<P>Some of the M&eacute;tis people, who had begun to establish agriculturalcommunities in the 1870s, were pushed off their land when Europeansettlers began to establish homesteads. One of the problems wasthat the M&eacute;tis people had laid out their farms in a mannersimilar to the French in eastern Canada, that is, in riverfrontlots. The survey system did not allow for this.<P>Church played an important part in most settlements. The churchand the school formed the social centre of early life in westernCanada.<P><TABLE>	<TD><IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/history/t_steamtract.jpg" ALT="Steam engine" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="160" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><form>	<input type="button" name="Button1" value="hi-res image"	onclick="window.open	('../../media/stills/agriculture/history/steamtract.jpg','bigwindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=yes,')"></form><br>In the early 1900s threshing machines were not often owned byindividual farmers, but custom threshing was common. Often with large steam driven engines. Because of the shortage of labourers for stooking and threshing and the factthat the crop was ready to be harvested at the same time overa large area, harvest railway excursions offered cheap fares tomen from the East who were willing to help harvest the wheat crop.In 1908 more than 14,000 men made the trip west.</TD></TABLE><P>As more settlers arrived, villages and towns were establishedevery seven or eight miles along the rail lines. The farmers inthe area had to be able to go to town and return and still havetime to do the daily chores. Some factors that could be consideredin the initial selection of the site for the town or village were:level ground, the water supply, the cost of the land and if theland was available. Some land was reserved for schools and Indianreserves or owned by the railway. <P>Following the drought of 1914, good harvests produced a largersupply of wheat than was demanded. This resulted in an oversupplyof grain, or a grain glut. Marketing wheat became more difficult.<P>Problems in farming during the time of the pioneers were similarto those of today. For example, they included early frost, droughtand choices in farm management and marketing techniques. Isolationwas a factor. Farmsteads were far apart and the speed of transportationwas very slow. Homestead lands were interspersed among railwayland, Hudson's Bay land and school land.<P>There were also problems with the livestock industry: poor qualitystock and a lack of processing facilities.</TD></TR></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ### CONTENT END ### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE><!-- ##### CONTENT TABLE END ##### -->	</TD></TR></TABLE>		</TD></TR><!-- ################ WHITEBODY END ################ --><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3 HEIGHT=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=3>	</TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE BEGIN # # # # # # # # # # -->	<TR><TD COLSPAN=3>	<TABLE WIDTH=587 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD WIDTH=116>	<TABLE WIDTH=116 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>	<TR><TD><!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="#pagetop" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('TopImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('TopImg')">	<IMG NAME="TopImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 	WIDTH=110 BORDER=0 	ALT="top of page"></A>	</TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD><!-- #### BLANKGUTTER #### -->	<TD WIDTH=28>	<IMG SRC="../../media/stuff/layout_transparent.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=1>	</TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<TD WIDTH=440>		<A HREF="./saskhis2.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('PrevImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('PrevImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT NAME="PrevImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="previous page"></A><!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->	<A HREF="./saskhis4.html" 		ONMOUSEOUT="hi_off('NextImg')" 		ONMOUSEOVER="hi_on('NextImg')">	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT NAME="NextImg" src="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" 	HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 BORDER=0 		ALT="next page"></A>	</TD></TR>	</TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # BOTTOMNAV TABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE><!-- # # # # # # # # # # MASTERTABLE END # # # # # # # # # # --></BODY></HTML>
