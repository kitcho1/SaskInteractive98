It was designed to entice settlers to western Canada.<P>The <B>Manitoba Act</B> provided legislation to enable the governmentto issue land to the M&eacute;tis people. This was accomplishedthrough the process of land scrip. A certificate was providedto each M&eacute;tis describing a specified number of acres andthe name of the person to whom the land was granted. A total of1,400,000 acres in the areas now known as Saskatchewan, Albertaand Manitoba was set aside in this manner.<P>Red Fife wheat was first introduced to the prairies.<P><LI><B>1871</B> -  Seven treaties were signed with the Indian to peoples.<P><LI><B>1877</B> - Indian reserves were established.<P>The first wheat shipment from western Canada was sent toGreat Britain.<P><LI><B>1879</B> - The buffalo herds disappeared from the prairies.<P>By this time many M&eacute;tis people had settled on farms aroundestablished missions.<P><LI><B>1880</B> - The federal government initiated programs to increase agriculturalactivities on Indian reserves.<P>During the 1880s ranching began in the southwest region of whatis now Saskatchewan.<P><LI><B>1880s</B> - <IMG SRC="../../media/stills/agriculture/history/t_mendel.jpg" ALT="Gregor Mendel" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">An Austrian scientist and monk, <B>Gregor Mendel</B> discovered the basic principles of heredity through carefully controlled experiments in cross breeding. His work paved the way for improving crops through genetics.<p>Hybrids are the offspring of parents from different breeds, varieties or closely related species. Hybrids are often superior in many ways to their parents - a phenomenon called hybrid vigour.

These complaints led to a royal commissionthat recommended the establishment of government regulations.<P>These regulations were introduced in the <B>Manitoba Grain Act</B> of1900. This was the first example of effective farm group action.<P><LI><B>1900</B> - The Manitoba Grain Act, now called the Canadian Grain Act, was passed.<P>The first mutual <B>hail insurance</B> was established.
