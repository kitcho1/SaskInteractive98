Archer, historian and former Provincial Archivist of Saskatchewan. The article was published in the Autumn 1985 edition of Canadian Parliamentary Review.<P><B><A NAME="1670">1670</A></B> - Most of what is present-day Saskatchewan was part of Rupert's Land which was granted by charter to the Hudson's Bay Company. Rupert's Land was headed by a Governor.<P><B><A NAME="1867">1867</A></B> - Canada became a country. The Canadian Government purchased the Hudson's Bay Company territories which became the North-West Territories in 1868.<P><B><A NAME="1870">1870</A></B> - Manitoba became a province of Canada. The Canadian Government appointed a Lieutenant Governor along with a council to administer justice and govern the new province and the NorthWest Territories. This arrangement lasted for about six years while the Canadian Government considered plans for development of the new lands.<P><B><A NAME="1874">1874</A></B> - The North-West Mounted Police headed west from Fort Garry to police the new lands.<P><B><A NAME="1876">1876</A></B> - The North-West Territories Act was proclaimed. The Act provided for a resident Lieutenant Governor in the North-West Territories who governed with the assistance of a five member council appointed by the federal government. Battleford was designated as the capital.<P>The Act also stated that an area not exceeding 1,000 square miles with a population of 1,000 British subjects of adult age would require an electoral district and would be able to elect a member to the council. When the number of electoral districts was more than twenty-one, the Council would dissolve and a Legislative Assembly would take its place.<P><B><A NAME="1882">1882</A></B> - Settlement of the prairies was getting into full swing. The Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed across the southern route and Battleford lost its importance as a trade centre. Regina became the new capital of the territory.<P><B><A NAME="1885">1885</A></B> -  Louis Riel led the North-West Rebellion in protest of the land survey and to press the federal government for Metis rights. Riel's forces met final defeat at Batoche by a Canadian force under General Middleton. Riel was later tried in Regina for treason and executed there in November 1885.<P><B><A NAME="1886">1886</A></B> - The west had been granted representation federally and took part in the 1887 federal election. N.F. Davis, owner of the Regina Leader, represented West Assiniboia as a Conservative.<P><B><A NAME="1888">1888</A></B> - The number of electoral districts in the territories reached twenty-two, and a Legislative Assembly was formed. The Lieutenant Governor was removed from the deliberations in the assembly but retained other favours.<P><B><A NAME="1901">1901</A></B> - Frederick W. Haultain was recognized the leader of the Assembly and informally as Premier of the Territories. Haultain now pushed the federal government for provincial status.<P><B><A NAME="1905">1905</A></B> - Saskatchewan (September 4) and Alberta became Canada's newest provinces. Haultain had pushed for one province with natural resources and education under provincial control. The Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier disagreed and created two provinces. Neither province was given control over natural resources, but in other areas they had the same rights and responsibilities of Ontario, Quebec and the other provinces.<P><B>1905</B> -  (December) The province's first election took place between the ruling Liberal party under Scott and the Provincial Rights party under Haultain. The Liberals won sixteen seats while the Provincial Rights party won nine seats.<P><B><A NAME="1906">1906</A></B> - In their first legislative session, Regina was named the capital of the new province, while Saskatoon was given the provincial university. This was set up by legislation in 1909.<P><B><A NAME="1908">1908</A></B> - A contract was let for the Legislative Building which was completed in 1912 at a cost of $3 million.<P><B><A NAME="1914">1914</A></B> -  Canada went to war in Europe as a member of the British World. Some 42,000 Saskatchewan men served in their country in this 1914 to 1918 struggle.<P><B><A NAME="1915">1915</A></B> - Prohibition was enacted and on December 31, 1916 Saskatchewan was officially "dry". This legislation was repealed in 1925.<P><B><A NAME="1916">1916</A></B> - Saskatchewan women were granted the right to vote. Sarah K. Ramsland was elected in a by-election in 1917 and was the first woman to serve in the Saskatchewan Assembly.<P><B><A NAME="1918">1918</A></B> - Armistice Day, November 11, marked the end of World War 1.<P><B><A NAME="1924">1924</A></B> - The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was formed.<P><B><A NAME="1930">1930</A></B> - Saskatchewan gained responsibility for its natural resources.<P><B>1930 - 1939</B> - The Great Depression. In Saskatchewan, 10 years of drought added to the devastating effect of low prices, unemployment and lost markets.<P><B><A NAME="1939">1939 - 1945</A></B> - World War II. Canada declared war on Germany September 10, 1939. More than 75,000 men and women joined up to serve on land, sea and in the air.<P><B><A NAME="1944">1944</A></B> - On June 15, a provincial Section was held. Premier Patterson, Liberal was defeated and T. C. Douglas became Premier of a CCF government.<P><B><A NAME="1945">1945</A> - Present</B> - The past fifty years have seen the development of Medicare, potash, agriculture, and many other industries. There have been a number of changes in government, prosperity and depression. Throughout it all, Saskatchewan has been a full and active participant in Canadian national life.<p></TD></TR></TABLE><!--<IMG SRC="../nav/back.gif" ALT="BACK"><IMG SRC="../nav/forward.gif" ALT="FORWARD">	-->	<!-- #### / WHITEBODY #### -->	</TD></TR><TR><TD>	<!-- PAGETOP JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="#pagetop">		<A HREF="#pagetop" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doTopBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			NAME="topBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_top1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=110 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to top of page"></A></TD><td></td><TD>	<!-- PAGEPREV JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="./trail_wood_qu.html">		<A HREF="./trail_wood_qu.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doPrevBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=left NAME="prevBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_prev1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Return to previous page"></A>	<!-- PAGENEXT JAVASCRIPT NAVIGATION -->		<A HREF="../sask_parks/index.html">		<A HREF="../sask_parks/index.html" ONMOUSEOVER="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 1)) return 			true;" ONMOUSEOUT="if (doNextBtnMouseOver(0, 0)) return true;"><IMG 			align=right NAME="nextBtn" SRC="../../media/stuff/qk_next1.jpg" HEIGHT=20 WIDTH=120 vspace="4" BORDER=0 			ALT="Go to next page"></A></TD></TR><!-- # # # # # # # # # # / MASTERTABLE # # # # # # # # # # --></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
