Saskatchewan Interactive 1998: A Guide to the Natural Resources of the Province

Educational content produced by GlobalEd Multimedia Technologies in 1998. I have no affiliation with GlobalEd (if they still exist).

Issues that I've encountered

- Videos (.mov) do not play natively
- QTVR (QuickTime VR .qtvr) videos definately do not play natively, need to be converted
- All audio content (.mov yet again) does not play natively
